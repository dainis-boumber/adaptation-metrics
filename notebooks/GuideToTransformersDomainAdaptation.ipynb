I have no evidence and no one has presented anything to me that indicates anything like that, Rubio told Meet The Press on Sunday. Suffice it to say I don t have any basis, I ve never heard that allegation made before by anybody. I ve never seen anything about that anywhere before.

Chuck Todd went on t ask Rubio if he would concede that if Trump is lying that it would be a huge political scandal and Rubio agreed.Here s the video via YouTube:Trump is desperate to distract everyone from focusing on his ever-growing Russia scandal, so he made up this lie based on a conspiracy theory he read on Breitbart in the hopes that Congress and the media will shift their focus.This is a serious accusation against a former president and Trump should be severely punished for it. He has offered no evidence to prove his claim and that means he is slandering President Obama, which should result in a lawsuit and impeachment.

              " 'Warner Bros. superhero tentpole Wonder Woman held on to the top spot at the box office while Universal\\'s Tom The Mummy reboot failed to unwrap big gains domestically as Hollywood\\'s bleak summer continued this weekend. [Wonder Woman â€” starring Gal Gadot as the Amazonian World War I peacekeeper â€” raked in $16 million Friday for an estimated $57. 2 million weekend total in its second week of release, according to Box Office Mojo. The Patty film, with a 93 percent \"fresh\" rating on reviews aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, fell just 45 percent in its second weekend for a domestic total of $205 million. The film has fared even better overseas, with its international tally standing at $435 million. Wonder Woman\\'s success â€” (the 45 percent drop is the one of the lowest ever for a superhero movie) â€” provides a shot in the arm to DC\\'s universe of superhero movies as Warners preps the launch of Justice League later this year. Meanwhile, Universal\\'s monster movie The Mummy debuted to a paltry estimated $32. 2 million frame to come in second place for the weekend. The Tom film, meant to launch Universal\\'s \"Dark Universe\" of monster movies, reportedly cost $125 million to produce before marketing, meaning the film will have to perform exceptionally well overseas to turn a profit for the studio. For comparison, each of the three Brendan Mummy films in the early 2000s opened higher than this latest iteration. Mummy did fare far better overseas, where Cruise\\'s name still carries a ton of star firepower. The film opened to an estimated $52. 2 million in China, a record for a film in the country, on its way to an international total of $141. 8 million, the best international launch for any film in the actor\\'s career. Universal undoubtedly hoped for a better opening for Mummy, as it was meant to serve as the first film in its \"Dark Universe\" series. Upcoming entries in the series are reported to include a Bill Bride of Frankenstein movie in 2019, and the Johnny The Invisible Man. Dreamworks Animation\\'s Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie came in third place with an estimated $12. 3 million haul. The animated movie featuring the voices of Kevin Hart and Ed Helms has earned $44. 5 million domestically, according to Box Office Mojo, a solid if unremarkable result for a film that reportedly cost just $30 million to produce. Disney\\'s Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales continued its underwhelming run at the box office with a estimated take of $10. 7 million and a finish, bringing its domestic total to around $135 million. Johnny Depp\\'s fifth outing as the buoyant Captain Jack Sparrow has delivered overseas, however, with an estimated global tally of close to $600 million. Disney\\'s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 rounded out this weekend\\'s top five with an estimated $6. 2 million in domestic receipts. The James superhero ensemble kicked off the summer season in early May with a $145 million debut weekend, and until Wonder Woman, was this summer\\'s only real box office hit. The film\\'s global haul stands at $828 million. Overall, the summer to date has been a disaster for studios, with only Wonder Woman and Guardians breaking out as bona fide hits. The season has suffered with a string of bombs, including Mummy, the aforementioned Pirates sequel, the Ridley sequel Alien: Covenant and Warner Bros.\\' Charlie King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. Other misfires included Paramount\\'s Baywatch reboot and the Amy Hawn kidnap caper Snatched. According to Bloomberg, theater companies AMC and IMAX have seen their stock fall precipitously this year due in part to poor box office results. Cowen Co. analyst Doug Creutz told the outlet that this summer\\'s offerings to date have collectively fallen $300 million short of expectations, and summer 2017 could beat out the summer of 2014 to become the worst summer at the box office since at least the . Industry observers will be holding out hope for other scheduled releases this summer, including next weekend\\'s Pixar animated sequel Cars 3, Michael Bay and Universal\\'s Transformers: The Last Knight, and Warner Bros\\' Christopher World War II epic Dunkirk. Other movies will include Universal\\'s Despicable Me 3, Pictures\\' : Homecoming and Fox\\'s War for the Planet of the Apes. View this weekend\\'s full box office results at Box Office Mojo.

              " 'Core Java Technologies Technical Tips View this issue as simple text September 10, 2002 In this Issue WELCOME to the Core JavaTM Technologies Tech Tips, September 10, 2002. Here you\\'ll get tips on using core Java technologies and APIs, such as those in Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SETM). Using ArrayList and LinkedList Using Zero-Length Arrays These tips were developed using Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, v 1.4. This issue of the JDC Tech Tips is written by Glen McCluskey. USING ARRAYLIST AND LINKEDLIST ArrayList and LinkedList are two Collections classes used for storing lists of object references. For example, you could have an ArrayList of Strings, or a LinkedList of Integers. This tip compares the performance of ArrayList and LinkedList, and offers some suggestions about which of these classes is the right choice in a given situation. The first key point is that an ArrayList is backed by a primitive Object array. Because of that, an ArrayList is much faster than a LinkedList for random access, that is, when accessing arbitrary list elements using the get method. Note that the get method is implemented for LinkedLists, but it requires a sequential scan from the front or back of the list. This scan is very slow. For a LinkedList, there\\'s no fast way to access the Nth element of the list. Consider the following example. Suppose you have a large list of sorted elements, either an ArrayList or a LinkedList. Suppose too that you do a binary search on the list. The standard binary search algorithm starts by checking the search key against the value in the middle of the list. If the middle value is too high, then the upper half of the list is eliminated. However, if the middle value is too low, then the lower half of the list is ignored. This process continues until the key is found in the list, or until the lower bound of the search becomes greater than the upper bound. Here\\'s a program that does a binary search on all the elements in an ArrayList or a LinkedList: import java.util.*; public class ListDemo1 { static final int N = 10000; static List values; // make List of increasing Integer values static { Integer vals[] = new Integer[N]; Random rn = new Random(); for (int i = 0, currval = 0; i = minval && indata[i] = minval && indata[i] <= maxval) { outdata[j++] = indata[i]; } } return outdata; } public static void main(String args[]) { // set up test array of integers int indata[] = new int[]{1, 3, -17, 8, 59}; // filter out values not in the range 1-10 int outdata1[] = filterData(indata, 1, 10); for (int i = 0; i < outdata1.length; i++) { System.out.println(outdata1[i]); } // filter out values not // in the range 100-200 int outdata2[] = filterData( indata, 100, 200); for (int i = 0; i < outdata2.length; i++) { System.out.println(outdata2[i]); } } } The filterData method does two scans of the input array. The first scan counts the number of valid data values. Then the method allocates a new array of the appropriate size, and copies the good values to it. If there are no good values, the method returns a null value for the array reference. The result of running the ZeroDemo1 program is: 1 3 8 Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.NullPointerException at ZeroDemo1.main(ZeroDemo1.java:72) The problem with this program is a rather basic one. The second call of filterData returns a null value, and the program fails to take this possibility into account. A better approach in this example would be to comment out the block of code that tests for the possibility of no valid data values: /* if (validcnt == 0) { return null; } */ When there is no valid data, the code will fall through to the next line, where a zero-length array is allocated: int outdata[] = new int[0]; This is perfectly legal Java usage. The representation of Java arrays includes the length of the array, and it\\'s therefore possible to tell if an array has zero length. For the ZeroDemo1 example, if you anticipate that validcnt will often be zero, that is, data filtering will often eliminate all values from the input, then you could optimize away the second input scan by adding code like this: int outdata[] = new int[validcnt]; if (validcnt == 0) { return outdata; } Note that usage such as: int outdata[] = new int[]{}; is also legal, to initialize an array with a zero-length set of integer constants. In general, it\\'s best not to return null from a method that returns an array type. Always returning an array, even if the array has zero length, greatly improves the generality of algorithms. If you anticipate that your methods will often return zero-length arrays, you might be concerned about the performance implications of allocating many such arrays. In this case, you can allocate a single array, and always return the same one, as follows: private static final int ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAY[] = new int[0]; This array is immutable (it can\\'t be changed), and can be shared throughout your application. There\\'s another way that zero-length arrays are used, as illustrated in the following example: import java.util.*; public class ZeroDemo2 { public static void main(String args[]) { // set up ArrayList and add strings to it List stringlist = new ArrayList(); stringlist.add(\"string 1\"); stringlist.add(\"string 2\"); stringlist.add(\"string 3\"); // convert to String array String out[] = ( String[])stringlist.toArray( new String[0]); for (int i = 0; i < out.length; i++) { System.out.println(out[i]); } } } The result of running the ZeroDemo2 program is: string 1 string 2 string 3 The ZeroDemo2 program sets up an ArrayList, and adds three strings to it. Then the program calls toArray to get a String array of the three elements in the ArrayList. In this example, the argument to toArray is \"new String[0]\". This argument serves a couple of purposes. First, if you have a String array that\\'s big enough to hold the elements of the ArrayList, you can specify it as the argument to toArray. The method will use the String array. But if your array is not big enough, then the toArray method allocates an array to return the elements. It uses the type of the array that was passed in to determine the type of the allocated array. ArrayList stores its element references in an Object array. The toArray method needs to be told if there is some other type (such as String) to be used for returning the array of elements. The method uses reflection (java.lang.reflect.Array.newInstance) to create an array of the appropriate type.

              " 'Federal appeals courts in the states of Washington and Virginia are set to hear arguments this week on the legality of President Donald Trump\\'s most recent travel ban, which sharply limits visitors and immigrants from eight countries, six of them Muslim-majority. Challengers, including the state of Hawaii and immigrant advocacy organizations and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), argue the ban is discriminatory and violates the U.S. Constitution. The Trump administration says it is necessary to protect the United States from terrorist attacks. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is based in San Francisco, will hold a hearing in Seattle, Washington on Dec. 6 and the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has its hearing on Dec. 8. Soon after taking office in January, Trump signed an order temporarily barring all refugees and visitors from seven predominately Muslim countries. The decision led to chaos at airports and numerous legal challenges and the administration eventually replaced it with a second, somewhat narrower order. When the second ban expired in September, Trump replaced it with a presidential proclamation indefinitely restricting travel from Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad, North Korea and barring certain government officials from Venezuela. The administration said the restrictions were put in place after a worldwide review of each country\\'s ability to issue reliable passports and share data with the United States. After the most recent order was issued, the same challengers who sued to stop the earlier bans went back to court. They said the new version still discriminated against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution. The lawsuits did not dispute the restrictions placed on Venezuela and North Korea. All refugees were temporarily barred as part of Trump\\'s first order but were not addressed in the latest ban. Instead, under a separate directive issued Oct. 24, refugees from 11 countries mostly in the Middle East and Africa now face additional security screening. The 9th circuit appeals court on Nov. 13 ruled the ban could go partially into effect for everyone without close family relationships to people in the United States. The White House has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to lift those partial restrictions while the cases are moving forward in lower courts so that the ban would apply to everyone. The government argues the president has broad authority to decide who can come into the United States, but detractors say the expanded ban violates a law forbidding the government from discriminating based on nationality when issuing immigrant visas. The administration has repeatedly said the ban is not discriminatory and pointed out that many Muslim-majority countries are unaffected by it. Trump has made statements, however, that his legal opponents say reinforce their contention that his actions are based in anti-Muslim sentiments. Last week, for example, the president shared on Twitter anti-Muslim videos posted by a far-right British party leader. In response to the tweet, Neal Katyal, attorney for the State of Hawaii Tweeted: \"Thanks! See you in court next week.\" The ACLU said in a letter sent to the Supreme Court on Monday that the group planned to file a motion that would expand the record to include the recent statements by the President.',\n",

              " 'Nothing betrays your official narrative that your administration is functionally well and you are not a crook like tweeting assurances from Fox News that your chances of being impeached are only slim. One might argue that frantically insisting that you are probably not going to get impeached only makes the notion that you probably are all the more reasonable. No sane president would get caught doing something so desperate.But Trump woke up and did just that.In another humdinger to add to a series of self-owns, Trump retweeted a video of Fox News host Geraldo Rivera insisting that Trump s chances of being impeached went from 3 percent (a number he pulled out of thin air) to 0 percent (another number he pulled out of thin air). In doing so, Trump inadvertently acknowledged that his chances of being impeached weren t zero before and are only zero now if you listen to the network that operates as state media for his administration.Trump s self-incrimination is a nice reminder of how troubled his administration is. In an effort to spin the testimony of the former FBI director he recently inappropriately fired, he is reduced to leaning on Fox News to make the case that the hearing didn t prove he was trying to obstruct justice (as most neutral observers noted) but actually it vindicates him somehow. It s a line of spin so patently absurd that even conservative pundits are having a hard time trumpeting it with a straight face.Enter Rivera. The longtime shockjock is, of course, among the least reputable men in journalism. His legendary fails include botching the opening of Al Capone s vault on live television, getting kicked out of Iraq after revealing U.S. troop positions to the enemy on live television, and saying Travyon Martin brought his murder on himself for wearing a hoodie on live television. Put Rivera in front of a camera, broadcast it live, and chances are he will do something to humiliate himself. He has become one of Trump s biggest defenders.It says something about Trump s chances of making it through his first term without being thrown out of office that he s just a few months in and already he s been reduced to using disreputable Fox hosts like Rivera to defend him. The fact that nobody else will risk destroying their reputation to stand up for him speaks volumes. Luckily, Trump is just dimwitted enough to keep reminding us of his precarious situation because he is fundamentally incapable of not tweeting incredibly stupid things each day.',\n",
              " 'A male colleague grabbing her leg. Another one suggestively rubbing her back. Others at work dinners discussing who they\\'d want to sleep with. Jane Park talked about experiencing all of this behavior in her career in business consulting and strategy. Never has she reported any of it to human resources or management. \"It\\'s made into such a big deal that you have to make a decision: Do you want to ruin your career? Do you want this to be everything that you end up being about?\" said Ms. Park, who is now chief executive of Julep, a beauty company she founded. \"What you really want to happen is that it doesn\\'t happen again. \" Her choice is more common than not, social science research shows. Employers, judges and juries often use women\\'s failure to report harassment as evidence that it was not a problem or that plaintiffs had other motives. But only a quarter to a third of people who have been harassed at work report it to a supervisor or union representative, and 2 percent to 13 percent file a formal complaint, according to a of studies by Lilia Cortina of the University of Michigan and Jennifer Berdahl of the University of British Columbia Sauder School of Business. Mostly they fear retaliation, and with good reason, research shows. In response to a New York Times report this month of payouts to women who had accused the Fox news host Bill O\\'Reilly of sexual harassment, 21st Century Fox, Fox News\\'s parent company, said: \"No current or former Fox News employee ever took advantage of the 21st Century Fox hotline to raise a concern about Bill O\\'Reilly, even anonymously. \" In interviews, women who worked at Fox said they didn\\'t complain to human resources because they feared they would be fired. Some women who experience harassment confront the perpetrator or confide in friends or family, the found. But the most common response is to avoid the person, play down what happened or ignore the behavior. Some don\\'t report a problem because they don\\'t think their experience qualifies as illegal harassment. An analysis of 55 representative surveys found that about 25 percent of women report having experienced sexual harassment, but when they are asked about specific behaviors, like inappropriate touching or pressure for sexual favors, the share roughly doubles. Those numbers are broadly consistent with other survey findings. Many victims, who are most often women, fear they will face disbelief, inaction, blame or societal and professional retaliation. That could be hostility from supervisors, a bad reference to future employers or the loss of job opportunities. Their fears are grounded in reality, researchers have concluded. In one study of employees, of workers who had complained about mistreatment described some form of retaliation in a survey. \"They become troublemakers â€” nobody wants to hire them or work with them anymore,\" Ms. Berdahl said. Paradoxically, official harassment policies and grievance procedures often end up creating obstacles to women\\'s ability to assert their rights, according to research by Marshall, a sociologist at the University of Illinois. \"That is in part because companies put them into place as mini litigation defense centers,\" Ms. Marshall said. \"The way employers deal with it is to prepare to show a court or jury that they did everything they could, rather than to protect women in the workplace. \" There are many ways that company cultures discourage people who are harassed from reporting it. Sometimes the harasser is a superstar â€” someone who makes the company so much money that he feels powerful and uninhibited in his behavior because the company has considerable incentive to look the other way. The more someone has a reputation for harassing, the less likely a woman is to complain, Ms. Berdahl said: \"It\\'s natural to conclude that if he\\'s been getting away with this for a long time, then the organization tolerates it, so why become the problem yourself by going to H. R.?\" Other times the human resources department has no interest in helping the employee â€” or there is no such department at all. This is common in Silicon Valley, where companies grow so fast â€” and where disdain for bureaucracy runs so deep â€” that human resources officials often serve only to recruit employees. In February, a former Uber engineer, Susan Fowler, wrote that when she reported to the Uber human resources department that her manager had tried persuading her to have sex with him on her first official day on her new team, the department declined to take action. It said she could change teams or accept what would probably be a poor performance review from the manager. Uber has a new human resources executive and is doing an internal investigation. Ellen Pao, a former partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers, described an atmosphere of sexism and harassment at the venture capital firm â€” with little recourse. In fact, it had no human resources department. She sued and lost a trial. Organizations that are very hierarchical or masculine can breed more harassment, and less reporting of it, according to studies, because gendered power dynamics are a big driver. That\\'s one reason that harassment has been rampant â€” and underreported â€” in the military. Most sizable companies have policies banning sexual harassment and require some sort of training in what it is and how to report it. But much of the training has been shown to be ineffective, and at worst can backfire. The best way to avoid sexual harassment and ensure that it\\'s reported when it happens is to bake it into company culture, from the top leaders on down, executives and researchers say. \"When you have an effective H. R. department that is supported by leadership, people feel safe about reporting harassment,\" said Bettina Deynes, vice president for H. R. at the Society for Human Resource Management, a professional association. \"It has a lot to do with the type of H. R. department: The motive is not the legal liability, but the culture you want. \" Culture is a squishy concept, but companies can do concrete things. One counterintuitive idea is to reward managers when complaints of harassment increase in their department, because it means they\\'re creating an environment where people are comfortable reporting it, according to a frank report published in June by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Here are some other ideas from the commission and researchers in the field: â–  Authorize dozens of employees throughout the organization to receive complaints, so that people can report to someone they\\'re comfortable with. â–  Hire an ombudsman. â–  Promote more women to positions of power. â–  Train people not in what not to do, but in how to be civil to colleagues, and how to speak up as a bystander â€” and have senior leaders attend the training sessions. â–  Put in proportional consequences, so that instances can be handled with conversations instead of firings or legal action. Ms. Pao, now the chief diversity and inclusion partner at the Kapor Center, a research, advisory and investment group that tries to make the tech industry more diverse, says she is pessimistic that company cultures will change unless it starts at the very top. \"If you could fix the problem, then everybody could move on and thrive,\" she said. \"But often it\\'s not just the one bad player, so you may want to get out of the culture. \"',\n",

On Monday, our beloved Commander-in-chief released a memo that is basically a guidebook on how to use military force for dummies.The document lays out specific details on national security-related topics, such as how and when to use military force. This is a major move by Obama and the first time a President has EVER had to do this to prevent a completely unqualified person from destroying everything. The Washington Post reported: On the eve of a new administration that has promised more aggressive counterterrorism operations, the Obama White House has released a lengthy compendium of its own policies governing the use of force.The 61-page document outlines eight years of the administration s legal opinions, executive orders and military directives. In a strong defense of the administration s actions, it lists rules for lethal drones and terrorist detention, and describes the international and domestic law that undergirds them. In the introduction of the guidebook, Obama said he d created it to reduce the risk of an ill-considered decision an obvious observation of Trump s lack of emotional stability and impulsive, erratic behavior. And then he wrote something that Trump will REALLY hate when he said it was critical to give as much information as possible to the public so that an informed public can scrutinize our actions and hold us to account.

              " 'Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here\\'s the .) Let\\'s turn it over to Jennifer Medina, a correspondent based in Los Angeles, for today\\'s introduction. Another day, another example of California\\'s continued fight with the Trump administration. The State Senate overwhelmingly approved legislation Monday that essentially turns California into a \"sanctuary state\" for undocumented immigrants. The bill expands protections for immigrants at a time when the Trump administration has expanded who is considered a priority for deportation. The legislation prohibits any state or local law enforcement agency from using resources to investigate, detain, report or arrest people for immigration violations. Under the legislation, county jails would not be able to allow officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to work inside the jails or notify them when a prisoner is being released. After the bill came under fierce criticism from the California State Sheriffs\\' Association, it was amended to allow local law enforcement officials to notify ICE of the release date of serious and violent felons. It also enables local law enforcement officers to alert federal officials if they come across someone who has a violent felony record and has been previously deported. Language in the bill was also changed to explicitly allow local agencies to participate in task forces even if they include immigration enforcement in investigations. The amendments did little to mollify the opposition. One Republican senator warned that the Legislature would be \"kicking the president right in the groin,\" with the law and warned that \"he will strike back. \" After the vote, Kevin de LeÃ³n, the leader of the state Senate and sponsor of the bill, said, \"Our communities will become more, not less, dangerous if local police are enlisted to enforce federal immigration laws. \" He called the passage of the bill a \"rejection of President Trump\\'s false and cynical portrayal of undocumented immigrants as a lawless community. \" Just before the Senate passed the sanctuary state bill, lawmakers approved legislation to start a fund that would pay for lawyers for undocumented immigrants facing deportation. Several Republicans spoke out against the legislation, saying it was an unfair use of taxpayer money and also contradicted the idea that the state wants to stay out of immigration enforcement. Both bills will now move to the Assembly. Gov. Jerry Brown has not indicated whether he would sign either one.

But the origins of the modern slackline, flat webbing strung loose enough to bounce like a trampoline, usually between two trees, is traced to Yosemite rock climbers in the early 1980s. It quickly grew into a sport. In the last five or so years, social media has helped to propel its popularity. The pinnacle of the sport is a variation known as highlining, meaning the line is affixed at height. Highliners wear tethers, though a small number of elite practitioners sometimes go without. Injuries can happen, but they are usually of the sprained ankle variety and involve lines a few feet off the ground, said Sonya Iverson, president of Slackline U. S. a group that promotes the sport. \"We aren\\'t daredevils or \" she said. Slackliners talk about the practice as a metaphor for the art of living â€” \"balancing everything on the line to demonstrate life\\'s possibilities,\" as the famed climber and highliner Dean Potter put it.

              " 'After Taiwan s state-run Mega Financial Holding Co was fined $180 million by U.S. authorities for lax enforcement of anti-money-laundering rules at its New York branch, the bank started a rigorous training program for its staff. Now, like Mega Financial, companies across Taiwan are working to get staff and systems up to speed after the island passed laws to meet international standards on combating money laundering and was taken off a watchlist by the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG). Unfortunately, Taiwan has earned a name for itself as a paradise for money laundering, Deputy Justice Minister Tsai Pi-chung told Reuters. Money laundering and cybercrime connections to Taiwan, which is also in the process of pushing through a cyber security bill, have grabbed global headlines. U.S. authorities fined Mega Financial $180 million last year for lax enforcement of anti-money-laundering rules at its New York branch. Some money from the $170 million cyber heist of India s Union Bank of India was transferred through Taiwan s Bank SinoPac. An international crime ring used malware to steal $2.6 million from the ATMs of Taiwan s First Bank. Taiwan was one of the six most targeted countries of the Wannacry ransomware attack earlier this year, according to security company Avast. Since 2011, 800 people from China and Taiwan have been deported from Cambodia on suspicion of telecoms fraud. Following its U.S. fine, Mega Financial said cleaning up its act is a top priority. U.S. authorities had said the Mega branch had been indifferent to the risks associated with transactions involving Panama, a high-risk area for money laundering. What happened at our New York branch was just terrible, said Robert Tsai, a senior executive vice president, referring to the fine and ensuing scandal. Half of our 6,000 clerks have been certified with anti-money laundering training. How each of our branches implements the rules and ensures proper training is the top priority for our business. To gain international confidence in its anti-money laundering measures, Taiwan will have to demonstrate it is putting the laws into practice. The APG will review Taiwan in 2018. The visit will focus on how effectively Taiwan will have actually implemented the anti-money laundering rules, said Liang Hung-lieh, partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers Taiwan. The APG s on-site review will be new to most of the assessed, including banks, non-bank financial institutions and in particular non-financial institutions such as lawyers, public certified accountants and other professional service providers. Under the anti-money laundering laws, these financial professionals will be required to report suspicious transactions, including bank transfers exceeding T$500,000 (US$16,500). They will have to determine where the money came from, provide details about the client and report that to Taiwan s newly established Anti-Money Laundering Office. These are similar to regulations that countries that have signed up to global anti-money laundering rules overseen by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) have adopted. The cost to companies of implementing the new rules may be significant as they put processes, workers and data systems in place. There s a lot of extra work for them to do now, such as determining the identities of their clients beneficiaries, said an official with the Financial Supervisory Commission, the island s financial regulator. He declined to be identified in the absence of permission to speak to the media. They don t yet know exactly what they have to do, and to what extent, to be considered compliant with the new regulations. They re going to need some time to digest all of these new rules, he said. The potential costs and increased difficulty of getting transactions done under the new rules worry those in the property market, said Wong Jui-chi, the spokesman for Taiwan s Chinese Association of Real Estate brokers, while emphasizing that his industry intends to fully comply with the regulations. The property market is already in a bad shape and these new rules will make things worse by making the process of real estate transactions more complicated. More or less everyone in our industry is complaining about it, he said.',\n",

Unlike America, being accused of bringing a fake bomb to school in Qatar isn t likely a guarantee you ll land a visit with their King.Within days of demanding a total of $15 million from the City of Irving and the Irving Independent School District, Clock Boy Ahmed Mohamed announced in a long distance phone interview from Qatar, he is homesick and wants to come home to Texas now.In October, Ahmed accepted a fully-funded education scholarship from the Qatar Foundation, an organization with reputed ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, over an invitation to MIT, which is among the most prestigious institutions of higher learning in the world. The family announced they would relocate to Qatar to accommodate his education, which they did.Happy #Thanksgiving!! Ahmed Mohamed (@IStandWithAhmed) November 26, 2015Dallas KTVT 11 (CBS) interviewed the teen from halfway around the world over Facetime. Now, Ahmed claims he misses Texas. I want to go back to a place where everyone knows me, meaning the kids he grew up with. He also hinted a trip to Dallas may be in the works over the Christmas holiday. He told the CBS affiliate he is ready to come home and wants to do so immediately, but insists last week s armed yet peaceful protest outside the Irving mosque stopped him.Breitbart Texas reported on the small group outside of the Islamic Center of Irving. The organizer released dozens of names and addresses considered Muslim and Muslim sympathizers over social media. The list, however, was posted on the City of Irving s website since March with the information of those who signed up to speak for and against the topic of American laws for American courts at an Irving city council meeting.Ahmed told the TV news outlet: I was scared because I ve heard what happened recently with, like, people with guns going to my local mosque, adding: I mean, they have the right to do that but it s scary because I m afraid, you know. Last week, through West Texas attorney Kelly Hollingsworth, Ahmed s family demanded $15 million plus apologies in letters that asserted they moved to the Middle East because threats and fear drove his family from Texas. However, Irving Mayor Beth Van Duyne received serious online threats and remains under fire over decisions made by the Irving ISD and Irving police to detain the high school freshman, who, on Sept. 14, brought into school a makeshift clock that resembled a briefcase bomb.The KTVT reporter pointed out that questioning the teen about the $15 million was something that nearly ended (the interview). He captured Ahmed s metered responses with eyes drifting off camera that appeared to look offside for approval from someone before answering questions. Ahmed first looked away when asked if he wanted to come back to Texas before answering yes with a smile. Clock Boy then told the CBS affiliate he was waiting for people to calm down back home before he returned.In a Christmas season blanketed by the Islamic State attacks in Paris, State Department travel alerts, and Syrian refugees at U.S. borders, sympathy continues to wane for the Islamophobia poster child. Breitbart News reported that the same liberal media that championed the teen s every move, including his Qatar Foundation-sponsored tour of Education City, lost interest.The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette added what little sympathy Americans had for the Clock Boy is gone thanks to a shameless money grab by the teen s family. The newspaper added that the Mohamed family s departure and subsequent demands make them look like opportunists, or worse.',\n",

              " 'The virtual currency Bitcoin has been swept up in yet another speculative frenzy, pushing its price toward the peak it last reached in late 2013. The price of Bitcoin has been buoyed by increased interest from places like Venezuela, where the local currency has lost much of its value, and India, where the government recently removed the largest cash notes from circulation. More broadly, a tilt toward isolationism that has emerged in American and European politics â€” highlighted by Donald J. Trump\\'s election victory â€” has given a new sheen to a currency that can move between countries with little oversight. \"The more there is an expectation for new barriers to be erected, the more there is an expectation that Bitcoin will be valuable for moving money across borders,\" said Gil Luria, the director of research at Wedbush Securities. Still, most of the people actually buying and selling Bitcoin these days are coming from a single country: China. Some wealthy Chinese have used Bitcoin to evade their government\\'s strict controls on moving money in and out of the country, according to Bitcoin specialists in China. But the heavy trading on Chinese Bitcoin exchanges, much of it by automated software, suggests that most of the price movement is a result of bets by speculators. In recent days, the price of a Bitcoin has been about 3 percent higher on these exchanges than on dollar denominated exchanges, suggesting more demand in China than outside. The importance of speculators suggests that the value of Bitcoin is still driven by the hope of how it might be used someday, rather than real world use today, which has generally been hard to quantify. In dollar terms, a Bitcoin was going for about $1, 025 on Tuesday, or about 140 percent more than what it cost at the beginning of 2016. The volatile price has led many analysts to conclude that is less similar to a currency than to a commodity, like gold, which has a value resulting from its scarcity. In Bitcoin\\'s case, the rules of the network dictate that only 21 million Bitcoin will ever be created. The recent rise has brought the price of one Bitcoin to within striking distance of the price of an ounce of gold, which was about $1, 150 on Monday. The price has increased in the last year despite the lack of interest in Bitcoin from banks and a majority of more sophisticated investors. After showing early interest in the currency, most big banks have moved on to make investments in the blockchain, the new type of ledger technology introduced by Bitcoin, while eschewing Bitcoin itself. Some central banks have talked about issuing their own national currencies on some sort of blockchain inspired by but unrelated to the blockchain that Bitcoin uses. Bitcoin and the blockchain were introduced in late 2008 by a mysterious coder who used the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Anyone with a computer and internet access can open a Bitcoin wallet and help maintain the blockchain ledger where all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. Because it is run by a decentralized network of computers around the world, Bitcoin does not require a central authority like a central bank or financial institution. That has made it attractive to people who hope to do financial transactions anonymously, such as the drug dealers who have sold illicit goods for Bitcoin on the Silk Road website and its successors. New Bitcoins are released at regular intervals to computers helping to support the Bitcoin network, and previously released Bitcoins can be bought and sold on exchanges around the world. Since 2009, the price of Bitcoin has generally been defined by long periods of stability marked by short periods of speculative excitement. The only other time the price of Bitcoin has exceeded $1, 000 was in late 2013, when the demand was driven by a surge of interest from Chinese investors and traders. The price soon crashed when one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, Mt. Gox, which was based in Tokyo and went bankrupt, announced that it had lost most of the Bitcoins held by its customers (the cause remains in dispute). The Bitcoin price fell to its low â€” under $200 â€” in early 2015. Since then, the price has risen in fits and starts, in part because of continuing hacking and fraud, and because of fights over the direction of the Bitcoin network. Many Bitcoin businesses have wanted to edit the basic Bitcoin software to change the number of transactions that can move through the network every day. But the proposed changes have run into opposition from the team of coders responsible for maintaining the basic Bitcoin software. Many Chinese Bitcoin companies have sided with the coders. That disagreement has led to slowdowns on the Bitcoin network, with some transactions taking days to be processed. The slowdowns have made it harder to use Bitcoin for everyday payments. But through the controversy the security of the basic Bitcoin wallets and transaction software has held up, making it a potential alternative for people in countries with less secure currencies and financial institutions. In November, interest in Bitcoin spiked in India after the government announced moves to quickly ban the largest Indian bank notes, in an effort to crack down on corruption. The continued fall in the value of the Venezuelan currency, the bolÃ­var, has led to reports about Venezuelans desperate to exchange their money for Bitcoin. But despite the new demand, the total value of all outstanding Bitcoin, about $16 billion, is still only that of a American company, and is not large enough to sustain the demand of even a moderate number of Indians or Venezuelans looking to store their wealth in the virtual currency. That points back to the importance of speculators, who are betting that someday soon people worldwide will turn to Bitcoin for their daily financial needs, and push the price much higher. \"I ascribe only 10 percent of the value of Bitcoin to current day usage, and more like 90 percent of it to the expectation of future usage,\" Mr. Luria of Webush Securities said.',\n",
              " 'First, let me warn you about the instructions of the markers. When I got them I was so excited that I opened the package without hesitation. I used one and nothing happened, no ink, no nothing; and I thought \"they don\\'t work!\" and then, I had an aha moment when I saw the instructions on the marker! The steps are so easy to follow that even my 3 year old daughter was helping me with the first two. So make sure to read the instructions to initiate the flow of the ink. I like the chisel tip to make broad and fine lines. They don\\'t squeak. The markers were just as expected, and they are great quality. They also arrived two days earlier than expected! The color is vibrant and really stands out. And they don\\'t have a strong odor that can give you a headache. And because of that I let my daughter use them on her mirror. She couldn\\'t believe me when I told her to do that (because that doesn\\'t happen around here), she ran as fast as she could before I change my mind! I can use them on my Pyrex to make sure someone won\\'t take it by mistake at gatherings, or for my \"to do list\" just in case I loose the paper version, or my daughter might think daddy\\'s car needs some color! So many things..... The only color I wish they have is purple, my daughter\\'s favorite color! We ended up using red and blue and voila, purple! But over all, I LOVE them!

              " 'China s Communist Party opened a meeting on Wednesday to make final preparations for a key party congress later this month, state media said, a five-yearly event where President Xi Jinping is expected to further tighten his grip on power. The seventh plenary session of the party s Central Committee will review draft reports on the work of the party, its discipline and anti-corruption commission, and amendments to be made to the party s constitution, all of which will be delivered at the 19th Party Congress that opens on Oct. 18, the official Xinhua news agency said. The congress will summarize historical progress and precious experiences in advancing socialism with Chinese characteristics gained with Xi at the party s core, Xinhua said. The congress will also thoroughly examine the current international and domestic situation and draw out guidelines and policies that respond to the call of the times, the news agency said, without giving specifics. Details of the speech that Xi, the party s general secretary, will give at the opening session of the congress are closely guarded secrets, although the event is more about ideology than concrete policies. It is unclear how long the plenum will last, but it could be just a single day. It will end with a long communique, issued by Xinhua, that is usually full of party phraseology but could be short on specifics. Last October, the party gave Xi the title of core leader, a significant strengthening of his position ahead of the congress, at which a new Standing Committee, the pinnacle of power in China, will be constituted. The party s constitution will be amended at the end of the congress, likely to include a reference to Xi s thinking or ideology as a guiding party principle. Mao Zedong and the reformist former leader Deng Xiaoping already have their names enshrined in the document, although Xi s two immediate predecessors, Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, do not.',\n",

To RSVP for this event, please email Natalie Raps at nraps@skdknick.com . Editorial: Grassley\\'s court maneuver threatens his legacy, reputation. The editorial board of the Des Moines Register writes: \"After 57 years in elected office and countless legislative accomplishments at both the state and federal level, Grassley seems destined to be remembered largely for this single, petulant act of politically motivated obstructionism... Over the course of six terms in the U.S. Senate, three terms in the U.S. House, and 16 years in the Iowa Legislature, Grassley cultivated a reputation for being a fair-minded, hard-working, bipartisan lawmaker. That well-deserved reputation is now badly damaged - perhaps irretrievably so.\" President Obama: Trump candidacy a key reason to confirm Garland now Today, President Obama weighed in on Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, saying it should incentivize Senate Republicans to confirm Chief Judge Garland now.

But now, \\'it seems to me [Republicans would] be better off going ahead and giving a hearing and a vote to somebody that they themselves in the past have said is well-qualified, is fair, and to treat the Supreme Court with the seriousness and the sense that it\\'s beyond politics, that it deserves,\\' Obama said. \\'Precisely because this election year has been so crazy, precisely because you have a number of Republicans who have said that they\\'re concerned about their nominee, it shows you why you don\\'t want to politicize a Supreme Court appointment.\\'\" Supreme Court punts on major case, showing the importance of a full and functioning high court. In a memo, People for the American Way notes that the Supreme Court\\'s decision to send Zubik v. Burwell-a major case concerning the Affordable Care Act-back to the lower courts highlights the crucial importance of a fully functioning Supreme Court. \"The Supreme Court issued a brief unsigned opinion today in the Zubik case, and vacated all the conflicting opinions...The result is to punt the issue away until the Court again has nine justices...While both sides can therefore claim some temporary victory from the Court\\'s ruling, the clear loser is our American justice system.\" Chief Judge Garland: the committed tutor.

When I first joined the NSM I knew it would be something I would stick with the rest of my life. It was not a club, a gang, or some fleeting thrill for the moment: it was a commitment to a way of life, and a direct link to many of our Forefathers who fought for Blood and Soil. Fellow Party members, most of you have taken the Oath of Loyalty to the Party, and those that have not yet taken your Oath, as read in the membership handbook, are expected to do so as soon as possible. It is a commitment, and proves you are serious about helping us to bring about changes in our Nation. It also creates Solidarity, and Kinship with your fellow Brothers and Sisters in our struggle. In this modern day materialistic Society to some an Oath, or pledge of Loyalty means nothing. For those of us that live by the Old Ways, breaking an Oath defiles your Honor, and leaves you with nothing but an empty shell that once held your life force. If a man cannot stay true to his Oath, then he is no man but rather a castrated maggot devoid of any trace of purity or an Aryan Soul. Your Oath also holds you to the battlefield, until this fight for our Race and Nation has been won. Members of the SS swear Loyalty to the FÃ¼hrer I often reflect about so-called Comrades that have abandoned their Oaths to the Party, and I wonder how they can live with themselves, as the rest of us face such a large scale enemy in Zog, and they give up without a fight, or before the fight is finished. We at Party HQ always hear a multitude of excuses from the Oath breakers. Sometimes their reasons are based in serious issues (still there is no reason serious enough to break your Oath) but more often than not it is trivial matters, such as personal problems with another member, so and so had their feelings hurt, or this or that person was not thanked enough for their work, or did not get promoted, or did not like a certain rule in the chain of command, or Religion, or insert excuse here ____. These same Oath breakers often claim to take great pride in the 3rd Reich, and CLAIM they are National Socialists. Truth be known, had they lived during the 3rd Reich and broke their Party Oaths there, especially in the war years, they might have met the hanging Judge Roland Freisler, and be dangling from piano wire! It comes down to this Comrades, and prospective Party members. If you are not serious about our Party leave now. I am opening the door now for any current member to leave, with their Oath intact. I want to shake out any of the uncommitted, non-serious members right now, considering they are not needed as we move forward to the frontlines. To the Prospects and Probate NSM members, this message is for you also. If you are not in this fight with us to the bitter end, now would be the time to walk away. Furthermore, the NSM does not operate as a Democracy: your pledge of Loyalty is to the Party and its Leadership. Honor your Oath, and your Pledge of Loyalty to the Party, or get out of our Ranks now while you still can! To the rest of you, the Party Faithful, the Warrior Archetypes, you men and women forged in Iron and steel ready to stand against the Zionist hordes, and their beloved illegal slave laborers: Your Party Salutes and Honors you! Providence has already promised us Victory in our fight, and your Ancestors march alongside you. In spirit, the men who fought at Valley Forge stand alongside of us, as do the brave men of the Alamo, as do the thousands that perished on the Eastern Front fighting Communism, and every other meaningful battle where our Racial Kinfolk have sacrificed their lives. Let those who abandon us, and break their Oaths, run away quickly with their tails between their legs. If they can live with that shame and dishonor, so be it. For the rest of us, Duty calls! Commander Jeff SchoepNational Socialist Movement A message from Director of the Media dept. of NSM 88!To all National Socialist Movement membership. Over the last several weeks we have heard from the Commander regarding the subjects of honor, duty, our oaths, and the proper behavior of a Comrade. We are a National Socialist organization, not a democracy, nor a social club, not a collection of individuals, but a united force for our volk. A NS organization is run on the Fuhrerprizip, a concept brought to us from our ancestors--trust and obedience to your superiors, responsibly and service to those in your command. For too long some amongst us have forgotten that no one individual is important, as our Fuhrer instructs, but that we are all in service to our volk. I personally, and on behalf of my state of Wisconsin, support all decisions of our Commander, who acts to unify us all in service to the movement that is the only hope for our people. We have been through hard times before my Comrades, and will again many times before all is said and done. From experience, we know that the mud slinging will be fast and furious, pay no mind. Accept information only from true sources, the rest is garbage. I am proud to be among you all, and to call you my brothers and sisters!M Sgt JohnsonWisconsin State LeaderDirector of NSM Media NSM/ MO. Statement: I have been asked to make a statement on behalf of NSM Missouri, although it is ridiculous that I anyone should have to say anything at all. Let me state unequivocally that the entire state of Missouri is behind the Commander 100%. Jeff Schoep has been a good friend as well as leader for a long time. The NSM is growing exponentially as is the state of Missouri. Much, if not all of that, is due to his leadership. Commander Schoep is exactly right - this is not a democracy. We are National Socialists. We recognise the Fuhrerprinzip. Fall in line or get out! I feel stupid even making this statement as only four people have left the party. Three of them were expelled and the fourth was the best friend and assistant of one of the expelled members! This kind of thing has gone on forever. Every political party does this (look at the republicrats). It happened in the NSDAP. It happened in the ANP. It is not unusual, strange, or unheard of. But one thing is certainly true: it is long overdue that we should put our petty individual egos/disagreements/problems aside and get on with the epic, monumental, historic, and absolutely mandatory task of saving our Race. Heil Hitler! MSgt. Steven Boswell NSM MissouriA number of other NSM Leaders have also issued similar statements, however this is more than enough to put this issue in its casket.

              " 'Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga, who withdrew from a presidential election re-run set for Oct. 26 saying it should only take place once wide-ranging reforms are undertaken, urged his supporters on Sunday to hold protests. Authorities have banned protests in central Nairobi and other hotspots in a bid to keep a lid on mounting political turmoil in the build-up to the repeat vote, in which Odinga had been set to challenge President Uhuru Kenyatta once again. The Supreme Court nullified Kenyatta s victory in the original election on Aug. 8, citing procedural irregularities. On Friday, Odinga said his withdrawal meant the poll had been canceled and that there should be fresh nominations for a new vote. Come out in large numbers tomorrow like you have done today and fear no-one. This is your country and you have the right to protest, he told a crowd in the coastal city of Mombasa. The election board has said the vote will go ahead, with Kenyatta facing six other candidates, none of whom polled more than 1 percent in August. During a trip to London last week, Odinga told Reuters that he might consider returning to the Supreme Court for clarification on whether the Oct. 26 poll was legal. I went to tell our friends in London the truth of what was happening here. Jubilee should know that we are not interested in a coalition government, he said, referring to Kenyatta s party. Despite the ban, protests have taken place in the East African country a regional and trade gateway which is the region s richest economy and an important Western ally in the fight against militant Islamists. On Friday, Kenyan police shot dead two people and wounded a third when a crowd tried to storm a police station in the town of Bondo in the southwest county of Siaya during a rally. Police also used teargas to break up small demonstrations in Kenya s three main cities Kisumu, the capital and the port of Mombasa the same day, defying the ban on rallies in city centers. Hospital authorities said 20 people were injured in Kisumu, an opposition stronghold. I am ready to die for change in Kenya, James Orengo, an opposition senator and lawyer who led Odinga s successful petition at the Supreme Court, told the crowd in Mombasa, which numbered in the thousands.',\n",

              " '(Want to get this briefing by email? Here\\'s the .) Good evening. Here\\'s the latest. _____ 1. Funerals began for some of the 41 victims of a suicide bombing at Istanbul\\'s main airport on Tuesday. The airport also reopened and the city appeared determined to get back to business as usual. Turkey, which faces terrorist threats from both Islamic State militants and Kurdish groups, has endured 14 major attacks in the past year. The government blames the Islamic State for this one, although it has not claimed responsibility. _____ 2. Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain returned to London from a European Union summit meeting, leaving the leaders of the other 27 member countries to discuss Britain\\'s decision to exit. Candidates to replace Mr. Cameron when he steps down this fall have begun to come forward, and talk of an early general election is growing. Juan Jasso, above, a who drew attention after video captured him enduring xenophobic insults in Manchester, said he was actually in favor of Britain\\'s leaving the E. U. _____ 3. There\\'s one thing Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump seem to agree on: toughening trade policies to protect American jobs. The two presidential contenders are deadlocked, according to a new poll, and each has the potential to draw voters from the opposite party. We look at how Mr. Trump has shifted his stances on issues, usually with few political consequences. _____ 4. Accusations surfaced on Wednesday that the Trump Institute, a education business to which Mr. Trump lent his name and likeness, plagiarized materials from an obscure real estate manual in 2005. (The institute\\'s owners were a couple accused of fraud.) The complaint comes as lawsuits from another of Mr. Trump\\'s forays into education, Trump University, cast a shadow over his presidential campaign. _____ 5. Mexico, Canada and the United States will use sources to generate half their electric power by 2025, their leaders announced at a summit meeting in Canada. Marketed as a gathering of the \"three amigos,\" the meeting of President Obama, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto of Mexico also served as a farewell of sorts for Mr. Obama and a debut for Mr. Trudeau. _____ 6. The extradition of the Mexican drug kingpin known as El Chapo has stalled. A lawyer for the drug lord, JoaquÃ­n GuzmÃ¡n Loera, who escaped from prison twice in Mexico, said two appeals filed this week could take years to resolve. The decision to extradite Mr. GuzmÃ¡n to the United States, where he faces charges in multiple jurisdictions, was made shortly after he was recaptured in January. _____ 7. Changes are coming to your Facebook news feed, and they aren\\'t good for publishers. (Ahem.) Expect more updates from your friends and family members, and fewer links posted by news media sites. Facebook says it\\'s concerned that the growth of publisher posts is making it harder for users to connect with people they know. _____ 8. Wimbledon served up a match on Wednesday, pitting Marcus Willis, who is ranked 772nd, against the Roger Federer, above right. Federer won. But Willis, who teaches tennis at a boat club in England, captured the hearts of fans and received a standing ovation from the crowd. \"It was a pleasure to play against him,\" Federer said. _____ 9. William Shakespeare was a social climber. Previously unknown records shed new light on the playwright\\'s pursuit of a coat of arms on behalf of his father, which would have cemented his own status as a gentleman. They also rebut the idea that Shakespeare wasn\\'t the author of the works attributed to him. _____ 10. Mermaid schools, which have been teaching girls in the United States how to swim with a tail for quite some time, are spreading to France. The teacher who began classes in that country said 500 people took her introductory course in Marseille, and she has plans to expand. Swim on, mermaids. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern. And don\\'t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a. m. Eastern, and Your Weekend Briefing, posted at 6 a. m.

The reconstruction is the same as the one I sent on the 5th October 1999, but I'm sending it again in case that e-mail isn't handy. The reconstruction has now been published, in the following paper: Briffa K.R. (2000) Annual climate variability in the Holocene: interpreting the message of ancient trees.

In preparation (to be submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research). Details about the file I'm sending you (repeated from 5th Oct 99): The data are attached to this e-mail. They go from 1402 to 1994, although we usually stop the series in 1960 because of the recent non-temperature signal that is superimposed on the tree-ring data that we use. I haven't put a 40-yr smoothing through them - I thought it best if you were to do this to ensure the same filter was used for all curves. The data I've sent are calibrated over the period 1881-1960 against the instrumental Apr-Sep tempratures averaged over all land grid boxes (that have observed data) that are north of 20N. As such, the mean of our reconstruction over 1881-1960 matches the mean of the observed target series over the same period. Since the observed series consists of degrees C anomalies wrt to 1961-90, we say that the reconstructed series also represents degrees C anomalies wrt to 1961-90. (I've already truncated the series at 1960 because of the problems with the recent period.) Best regards Tim\",\n",

              " 'Mayor Bill de Blasio posted a video on his City Hall Twitter account on Tuesday that featured two Broadway actors singing his praises and promoting his accomplishments, drawing criticism from government watchdog groups who said that it was an inappropriate use of public money and was too much like a campaign ad. The video, which tries to poke fun at itself even as it promotes the mayor, was posted on the official City Hall Twitter account, @NYCMayor, and features Mr. de Blasio in an awkward thespian effort. It also includes his wife, Chirlane McCray a senior adviser, Andrea Hagelgans and two Broadway stars, Jenna Ushkowitz and James Monroe Iglehart. Ms. Ushkowitz starred in the television show \"Glee\" and has appeared in Broadway musicals, including \"Waitress\" and \"Spring Awakening. \" Mr. Iglehart won a Tony Award in 2014 for his role as the Genie in \"Aladdin. \" The video shows Mr. de Blasio, who is running for in the coming year, sitting in the back of what appears to be one of the mayoral sport utility vehicles, talking with Ms. McCray on his cellphone. \"Hey honey, I really like this song idea,\" he says. \"I really think it\\'s the perfect way to wrap up all the great things we\\'ve done this year. \" Ms. McCray, Ms. Hagelgans and the actors are shown in a room at Gracie Mansion. Ms. McCray puts the mayor on speaker phone so he can listen as the two actors sing, accompanied by a piano player. \"In case the folks are unaware, we\\'ve got some facts we\\'d like to share,\" they sing. They go on to plug mayoral programs like protections for renters, the construction and preservation of affordable housing, and a mental health initiative. \"Who\\'s bringing cops and community close?\" Ms. Ushkowitz sings as the beat goes . \"Who\\'s got incarceration and crime rates sinking to a record low?\" The performance closes with a rousing reference to Mr. de Blasio. \"No matter what will be, we\\'ve got Billy D. B. !\" Ms. Ushkowitz belts out. The mayor starts out nodding happily to all the praise but then whispers to an aide, \"This is kind of over the top. \" In the end, he delivers his review of the performance: \"Maybe the song\\'s a little too elaborate,\" he says. \"Maybe we should just do a couple of tweets and a Facebook post instead. \" Dick Dadey, the executive director of Citizens Union, a government watchdog organization, questioned whether creating the video was a justifiable use of public resources and said it raised questions because it came right before next year\\'s campaign. \"This is a virtual campaign ad that is meant to be a announcement but goes beyond that in serving to promote the mayor,\" Mr. Dadey said. The video is part of a broader effort by City Hall to increase its use of the internet and social media to reach out to New Yorkers directly, bypassing traditional news media. It also comes as Mr. de Blasio controls his interactions with the press, frequently avoiding questions and limiting the news conferences at which he will take questions on any topic to once a week. Eric Phillips, Mr. de Blasio\\'s press secretary, said that the video was produced by City Hall staff and that the actors volunteered their time. Mr. Phillips said that City Hall spent a total of $700 to pay the piano player and a composer. He said it cost an additional $170 to have the piano tuned and $30 to rent a rehearsal room. Although the mayor is running for next year, Mr. Phillips said in a written statement that the video \"doesn\\'t have anything to do with his campaign. \" He added, \"We think New Yorkers have a right to know what their government does, and it\\'s our job to communicate that work in a modern way. \" The immediate effect of the video was not exactly the stuff of Broadway hit material. In the first seven hours after the video was posted on Twitter, it had received 218 likes on the mayor\\'s account and 88 retweets.',\n",

Date: Friday, October 12, 2001 1:24:39 GMT Subject: Yall I know yall are tired and need a brake. But I\\'m going to let yall know, while yall are taking that brake, the devil is going to come in on that brake and do his work for you. Hope when i talk to you last, I asked were you going to be at choir rehearsal and you said, \"Why i ain\\'t going to be there Sunday.\" and you are right, but do you have to get all your blessing through the week, and then give him the praise on sunday. You of all people know that you don\\'t need to have a sunday moring experience on sunday, you can have it in a jail tank on tuesday and wendsday. When you are in a relationship, you are going to do all you can to make it work, if you or quentin didn\\'t have ride, why didn\\'t yall ask me, have i ever turned yall down. Make it work. Quentin, where have you been. I am going to real with ya. When you started coming to the church, You and I was thrilled. I was like finaly, i got someone who is on my level who if in case didn\\'t have a right spirit, I could lift up and if i didn\\'t have the right spirit, he could lift me up. I felt that now it\\'s not only me who can get through to these other young men and be there sort of mentor. I have help now, i don\\'t have to be the only one checking on Matthew, Woyne, Damion, Anthony, Marcus, Mann, Kalid, Howard, Devin, and not to mention the girls. Now me and him can be there Accounters, especially for the first four. Well now we don\\'t have to worry about at least one of the the four, Matthew. I\\'m not sure, but he doesn\\'t go to the church anymore, nor his family. And i am not saying it your fault, but you act like if they are not rapping, you don\\'t need to be worried about them, i\\'m being real. I always ask you,\"Q, have you talk to the boys.\" I can\\'t stress this enough, Your presence at the church is greatly missed. And you might say\" well, everybody ain\\'t able to have a nine to five, you got to take what you can get.\" And that is exactly what the devil wants you to feel...Notice I never said your presence on suday morning is greatly missed, i said your presence at the church is. Powertime, Choir Rehearsal, Young adult functions, Afternoon functions, 2nd services, Meetings...You might not see it, but the only God that some of the people might see is through you. You might say, \"Well, if they are going to church just to see me, then they are going for the wrong reason.\" right. But everybody is not on the same spiritual level as us. They are following by example and if they never see you we may never see them. And Hope you already know how we feel about you and the kind of spirit your presence bring. Hope I told you in an email before i went to jail that i almost wanted to give up. And i was still considering it when i typed that. Be careful of what you asked because you just might get it. On that day, I was at work. My supervisor asked me to take some checks down stairs about 4 floors down. I waited for an elevator for a good three minutes, and i figured this was my chance to really talk to God. And i asked hime to give me a renewed spirit, but not all of sudden. Let it be gradually. I promise, when i said a man the elevator opened. Well that evening i went to jail. And it was in that jail tank, God renewed my spirit. Now i can go to choir rehearsal again without thinking about how much i don\\'t like Andrew, I can still go to church even though two vital families aren\\'t there (Davis\\'s and the Abrahams), i can type this letter to yall, and still not worry how yall might see me later. All i am saying is don\\'t wait until you hit rock bottom to be about God\\'s business again. It\\'s Real good that you Believe in God and you read your Bible. Keep in mind that The devil also belives in God and knows the Bible back wards and forwards, He comes to Steal (Davis\\'s and Abrahams) Kill (Our Spirit) and Destroy (Our Church). Please take heed to what I am saying and I am not saying this because I want to get under yalls skin, i am writing it because i am not holding nothing in anymore, because thats what got my spirits down in the first place. And still much luv, You know how we do it. WWJD',\n",

              " 'Donald J. Trump, defending his recent phone call with Taiwan\\'s president, asserted in an interview broadcast on Sunday that the United States was not bound by the One China policy, the diplomatic understanding that underpins America\\'s relationship with its biggest rival. Mr. Trump, speaking on Fox News, said he understood the principle of a single China that includes Taiwan, but declared, \"I don\\'t know why we have to be bound by a One China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade. \" \"I mean, look,\" he continued, \"we\\'re being hurt very badly by China with devaluation with taxing us heavy at the borders when we don\\'t tax them with building a massive fortress in the middle of the South China Sea, which they shouldn\\'t be doing and, frankly, with not helping us at all with North Korea. \" Mr. Trump is not the first incoming Republican president to question the One China policy, but his suggestion that it could be used as a chip to correct Chinese behavior sets him apart, several Asia experts said. While Mr. Trump has been praised by some Republicans for taking a new look at China policy, his stance could risk a backlash by Beijing, the analysts said. Not since 1972, when President Richard M. Nixon and Mao Zedong enshrined the One China principle in the Shanghai CommuniquÃ©, has an American president or so publicly and explicitly questioned the agreement, which resulted in the United States\\' ending its diplomatic recognition of Taiwan in 1979. A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Monday that the government had \"serious concern\" about Mr. Trump\\'s remarks, renewing a debate that erupted nine days ago when he took a congratulatory phone call from President Tsai of Taiwan. At first, Mr. Trump played down the implications of the call, saying he was just being polite. Later, his aides said he was well aware of the diplomatic repercussions of speaking to Taiwan\\'s leader. Lobbyists for Taiwan, including the law firm of former Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, spent months laying the groundwork for the call. On Friday, China\\'s senior foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, met with Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, whom Mr. Trump has designated as his national security adviser, according to a person told about the meeting. It was not clear what the men had discussed. Some Republican foreign policy experts â€” including John R. Bolton, who is believed to be a for the post of deputy secretary of state â€” have praised Mr. Trump for shaking up a diplomatic agreement. As a candidate, Ronald Reagan criticized the decision to abrogate recognition of Taiwan after his election, he invited a delegation from Taiwan to attend his inauguration, antagonizing Beijing. In 1982, as president, Reagan pushed for the Six Assurances, one of which was a reaffirmation that the United States did not formally recognize Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan. Still, he abided by the terms of the 1979 joint communiquÃ© that established relations between the United States and China. But Mr. Trump\\'s suggestion that the policy could be wielded as a chip in a broader negotiation with China has implications not just for Washington\\'s relationship with Beijing, several experts on Asia said, but also for America\\'s support for Taiwan. \"By putting One China up for grabs, Trump will suck all the oxygen out of the U. S. relationship, and it risks eventually trading away U. S. support for Taiwan for another U. S. interest,\" said Evan Medeiros, a former senior director for Asia at the National Security Council. \"There are good reasons why eight presidents since 1972 have relied on the One China policy,\" he added. \"This is one area where the Trump team would do well to heed the lessons of history instead of bucking them in the uncertain hope of getting something. \" Jeffrey A. Bader, Mr. Medeiros\\'s predecessor in the Obama administration, said the One China policy had \"always been seen as a foundation of the relationship. \" \"Now Trump apparently sees it as part of a broader set of new transactions,\" he said. \"Mixing trade with an issue seen by Beijing as involving sovereignty is likely to produce an angry Chinese backlash and worsen both issues. \" An editorial on Monday in The Global Times, a Chinese tabloid, said that Mr. Trump was \"like a child in his ignorance of foreign policy. \" \"The One China policy cannot be bought and sold,\" the editorial said. \"Trump, it seems, only understands business and believes that everything has a price. \" Mr. Trump, however, did not appear worried about inflaming Beijing. He repeated in the Fox News interview many of the criticisms he has made about China, emphasizing what he said was its unwillingness to help curb the nuclear ambitions of its neighbor North Korea â€” an issue that foreign policy experts believe could confront Mr. Trump as the first geopolitical crisis of his presidency. The said he would not tolerate having the Chinese government dictate whether he could take a call from the president of Taiwan. He reiterated that he had not placed the call, and described it as \"a very short call saying, \\'Congratulations, sir, on the victory. \\'\" The Chinese government, which once viewed Mr. Trump favorably as an alternative to the hawkish Hillary Clinton, has struggled to respond to Mr. Trump\\'s unorthodox approach. China\\'s foreign minister, Wang Yi, initially played down the significance of the phone call, calling it a \"petty action by the Taiwan side\" that he said would not upset the longstanding policy of One China. But as Mr. Trump has repeated his campaign criticisms of China â€” and as his statements about Taiwan have rippled throughout the region â€” Beijing has noticeably hardened its tone. It warned him last week, in a editorial in the overseas edition of People\\'s Daily, that \"creating troubles for the . S. relationship is creating troubles for the U. S. itself. \" In a pointed rejoinder to Mr. Trump, the editorial said that pushing China on Taiwan \"would greatly reduce the chance to achieve the goal of making America great again. \"',\n",

              " 'The political left and the mainstream media (but I repeat myself) still reeling from the results of the November election, found traction this weekend in the debate over crowd sizes with the new Trump administration. [For their purposes, it matters less what the Trump said, and even less what the crowd sizes were (or why) and more that they were able to create a common filter through which they will interpret subsequent events as they muster an opposition (pretentiously called \"resistance\"). First, the facts. The crowd on Inauguration Day was massive, and from the front sections â€” where this reporter was lucky enough to have seats â€” it looked like the entire mall was full. Trump â€” and anyone else seeing the event from that vantage point â€” could be forgiven for thinking the crowd was at least a million strong, or more. Taking him to task for speculating about that was simply petty. Press Secretary Sean Spicer was correct: the media were trying to undermine the new president. At the same time, the crowd did not feel overwhelming. And that was partly by design. The left did its best to scare Trump supporters away by threatening violence. Furthermore, the timing (on a Friday) and the high price of traveling to, and staying in, Washington over a weekend kept many Trump fans at home. A good portion of the protesters who came in from out of town had probably already booked their travel plans in anticipation of a Hillary Clinton win, driving prices up. The size of the crowds at the respective events was not an issue until the media made it one. In his combative statement to the press on Saturday, Spicer correctly noted that there were some media reports of crowd size that were clearly manipulative. The presence of additional security â€” again, required because of threats â€” did slow entry onto the Capitol lawn and the Mall. (How easy the left often has it: threaten Republicans, then mock them in the media for taking you seriously!) Most Trump fans were probably happy to see Spicer take the media to task â€” especially over the false report that President Trump had removed a bust of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. from the Oval Office. That bogus story was undoubtedly motivated by the media\\'s continued quest to find evidence of racism in the Trump camp. It was classic fake news, a clean bust (no pun intended). So, naturally, media critics focused on the more dubious claim that Trump\\'s crowds had rivaled Obama\\'s. To make his case, Spicer presented what Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway later called \"alternative facts\" â€” a harmless, and accurate, term in a legal setting, where each side of a dispute will lay out its own version of the facts for the court to decide. In the heated debate, however, the term quickly became a meme as a euphemism for \"lying\" â€” in much the way that a Bush aide inadvertently gave the mainstream media a badge of honor when he used the phrase \" community. \" Trump was not lying â€” nor were Spicer, or Conway. They were merely giving their version of events. But CNN and the New York Times explicitly said that Trump had made \"false\" claims, whether about crowd size or the media, even when his claims were clearly supportable opinion. It was not enough for journalists to find, and report, the facts independently, and let their readers or viewers decide. They decided to be argumentative â€” and laid down a marker, \"Trump lied,\" on Day One (or Two). In some ways, that was simply the media reverting to what they had done under the Bush administration, the last time they had to cover a Republican in power. We are likely to hear a lot more about \"alternative facts\" in the future, stripped of its original (benign) context and used as the foundation for an alternative reality. There is nothing even Trump can do to stop that. But the new administration could choose its battles more carefully, and perhaps learn to deliver rebukes with a smile. Joel B.

The justices narrowed the scope of lower court rulings that had completely blocked key parts of a March 6 executive order that Trump had said was needed to prevent terrorism attacks, allowing his temporary ban to go into effect for people with no strong ties to the United States. [nL1N1JN0M6] \"We always believed that the Muslim ban that President Trump imposed soon after assuming office had no basis in facts and would not help fight terrorism,\" Iran\\'s Mohammad Javad Zarif told a joint news conference in Berlin with his German counterpart. Zarif called the U.S. decision the \"greatest gift\" for militant groups seeking new recruits. Separately, Zarif tweeted: \"A bigoted ban on Muslims will not keep US safer. Instead of policies empowering extremists, US should join the real fight against them.\" Zarif said the travel ban punished people who had never been convicted of a terrorist act, while people from other countries involved in past attacks would not be affected. \"For some terrorism and support for terrorism is measured by the amount of arms they buy from the U.S, and not by actually being involved in acts of terrorism,\" he said, in an apparent reference to recent U.S. approval of $110 billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Saudi citizens are not affected by the travel ban. Zarif did not mention Saudi Arabia by name but the ultra-conservative Sunni Muslim kingdom is the arch-foe of Shi\\'ite Iran in the region.',\n",

              " 'MELBOURNE, Australia â€” The sibling rivalry, at least on the tennis tour, started right here at the Australian Open for the Williams sisters. It was 1998, and older sister Venus beat younger sister Serena, (4) in a match that â€” as intrusive as it felt to watch â€” surely drew more attention than any match in history between a pair of Australian Open debutantes. The fascination in their dynamic and their futures was there from the start in Melbourne Park, known then as Flinders Park when it had only one stadium with a retractable roof instead of three. A picture of Venus consoling Serena after the match was on the front page of The New York Times. Though it would be tempting to label their Australian Open final on Saturday as a moment and to speculate that it might be their last meeting at this late a stage of a Grand Slam tournament, it seems best to resist the temptation. The Williams sisters have taught us a lot about the limits of conventional tennis wisdom through the years. And so, even if 19 years have passed and Serena is now 35 and Venus 36, it is wise to avoid fencing them in again after they have run roughshod over so many other preconceptions. \"I watched Venus today celebrating after she won the semifinal like she was a girl, and it made you want to cry for joy just watching her,\" said Marion Bartoli, a former Wimbledon champion. \"Such a powerful image, and it makes you think about all those questions she was getting: \\'When are you retiring? Have you thought about retiring? How much longer?\\' \"You must let the champions decide when the right moment comes. \" The Williamses are both great champions, even if Serena is clearly the greater player with her 22 Grand Slam singles titles and her long run at No. 1, a spot she can reclaim from Angelique Kerber with a win Saturday. Serena has been the most prolific Grand Slam winner after age 30 in tennis history, and she is back in rare form again after another extended break at the end of 2016. She disconnected completely from the game and physical training initially and had to push hard to get back in shape in November and December. It worked. She has not dropped a set here despite a challenging draw, nor has she even been pushed to a tiebreaker. Newly engaged to the American technology entrepreneur Alexis Ohanian, who has watched her matches from the players box, and seemingly refreshed, Serena deserves to be the favorite to win her 23rd major singles title and break her tie with Steffi Graf for the highest total in the Open era. In this tournament, Serena has beaten two former members of the top 10 â€” Belinda Bencic and Lucie Safarova â€” and one current member, the No. 9 seed Johanna Konta. Venus\\'s draw has been soft by comparison, devoid of top 10 players â€” past or present â€” and including only one seeded player: No. 24 Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. On Thursday, she had to scrap and come back to win, (3) against the powerful unseeded American CoCo Vandeweghe, while Serena cruised past the unseeded Croat Mirjana . Serena, who already holds a edge over her sister, could be the fresher player, too, on Saturday. But the psychology remains complex and the fallout unpredictable, even after all these years. \"When I\\'m playing on the court with her, I think I\\'m playing the best competitor in the game,\" Venus said. \"I don\\'t think I\\'m chump change either, you know. I can compete against any odds. No matter what, I can get out there, and I compete. \" They have not played since the 2015 United States Open, when Serena won, in a quarterfinal in which Venus attacked, often successfully, from the start but had no answer in the end for Serena\\'s ultimate weapon: her first serve. It was an intense match in which the big crowd in Arthur Ashe Stadium seemed more reflective than fully engaged one in which Serena\\'s celebration was understandably subdued with her sister across the net, even if their matches are no longer the awkward, constricted affairs of their early years. Saturday\\'s final in Melbourne could be intriguing on multiple levels, in part because of the Australian public. Venus is viewed here, as elsewhere, as a sympathetic figure: the older sister who has handled the younger\\'s greater tennis success unselfishly and with dignity. And though both sisters have had to cope with major health problems and family tragedy, with the murder of their half sister Yetunde Price in 2003, Venus is the one whose tennis fortunes dipped more dramatically. A Grand Slam singles champion and a former No. 1, she did not advance past the third round in any major event in singles from late 2011 to the end of the 2014 season. She was a major star reduced to a minor role, largely because of an autoimmune disorder â€” Sjogren\\'s syndrome, diagnosed in 2011 â€” that sapped her strength and endurance. When Russian hackers breached the World Agency\\'s databases last fall, it was revealed that Venus had needed 13 exemptions for drugs in recent years. The retirement questions to which Bartoli referred started during that period. But Venus\\'s ability to cope with her condition has improved, and after rejoining the top 10 in 2015, she reached the semifinals at Wimbledon last year and then the final here. \"She never even thought of the word retire,\" said David Witt, her coach and hitting partner of 10 years. \"I just think when she got diagnosed, it was a step back, a shock. She\\'s learned a lot about how to deal with it and her body, how to eat, how to manage it. \"There are days she can\\'t work as hard as she wants to work. Some days it\\'s maybe not smart to do it because it will then hurt you for two or three more days. Where she is now in her career, she has to listen to her body, and I don\\'t think she really needs to go out and hit balls for two hours. \" Witt said there were no more sessions in the or in time off tour: just one session in the morning and then gym work, primarily sprints, core strengthening and flexibility. \"It took her years and years to realize that stretching is important and can keep you healthier,\" he said. \"The more flexible you are, you\\'re not going to strain or pull anything. I\\'ve been with her 10 years, and I think it took seven years to get her to stretch. She likes to do a lot of dancing, and that consists of a lot of stretching and being flexible, so I think that\\'s helped. \" Her dance skills were in evidence Thursday as she pirouetted after beating Vandeweghe, but what will linger longest in memory were her screams of delight at having conquered an inspired young opponent in a semifinal. It was a moment she described as \"just joy. \" \"You could really see the happiness on her face,\" Serena said. \"I\\'ve been there when she was down and out of it, and back and in it. I\\'ve been there for all those moments, so I just really was oh so happy. \" As visceral as her reaction on court was, she was nothing but considered in the interview room. \"I think why people love sport so much is because you see everything in a line,\" Venus said. \"In that moment, there is no . There\\'s no retake. There is no . It\\'s triumph and disaster witnessed in real time. \"This is why people live and die for sport, because you can\\'t fake it. You can\\'t. It\\'s either you do it or you don\\'t. People relate to the champion. They also relate to the person who didn\\'t win, because we all have those moments in our life. \" This will be Venus\\'s first major singles final since she lost to Serena in straight sets in the 2009 Wimbledon final, and her first match against Serena in Melbourne since the 2003 final when Serena won her fourth Grand Slam title in a row, having defeated Venus in all four finals. \"It\\'s just amazing,\" said Rennae Stubbs, the Australian star who first met the sisters before they joined the tour. \"They came onto the scene at age 15 and 16 with the beads and the hair and the exuberance, and here they are: mature, remarkable young women at 35 and 36. No matter what anyone says to me, their story from start to finish is the greatest sports story ever. \" And if the Williamses have taught us anything along the way, it is that the story is not finished until they say it is.',\n",

              " 'Email  Chambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne announced that all early voting in the county was once again on the iVotronic machines after one day of early voting using paper ballots. The emergency usage of paper ballots took place on Tuesday, October 25 while a software problem was being resolved. The vendor corrected the problem and reinstalled the corrected configuration in time for all ballots the next day, according to Hawthorne in a press release on October 27.  The situation was recounted by ABC 12 News: An error in the voting machine programming by Election Systems & Software (ES&S) caused votes for one statewide court of appeals race not to be entered when a voter tried to vote straight ticket in either party according to a release from Chambers County.  Chambers County, Texas, is a small county, having only 13 precincts and only four early-voting locations. County Clerk Heather Hawthorne told The New American 1,801 ballots were cast before switching to the paper ballots. Some of those 1,801 voters were warned to double check their ballots due to the software glitch. Because Chambers County is a Republican stronghold, the Republican candidate will be more adversely affected than the Democratic candidate by unintended under-votes. The question is how many unintended under-votes were there for these candidates and how close will that contest be?  There was a similar ballot problem in 2010 in Travis County, Texas, although the 2010 error was made on the paper ballots. A number of military absentee voters who were bona fide Texas residents were accidentally sent ballots for federal overseas voters. The ballots for federal overseas voters did not include local contests, such as ones for the Texas House of Representatives, and it was impossible to vote for that contest using the ballots provided. Republican Dan Neil lost by 16 votes. The final vote total was Donna Howard (D) 25,026, Dan Neil (R) 25,010 and Ben Easton (L) 1,518. Neil challenged the election total for a number of reasons, in addition to the ballot format, but the Texas Legislature, even though it was supposedly solidly Republican, seated Howard even though a very common practice in such close elections is to seat neither candidate, pay both candidates, and give both candidates equal access to the building and caucuses while the dispute is resolved or a new election is called.  In this case in Chambers County, the affected contest is a judicial contest. Hopefully, it will not be as close as the House District 48 race in 2010.  The voters who were affected by the Chambers County computer glitch were fortunate the errors were obvious enough for voters to notice and bring to the attention of the election officials. How many errors go undetected because they are not obvious to the voters or the election processes are not transparent? Errors such as this serve as a reminder of how important it is that voting have a paper trail and be a transparent process with plenty of paper documentation in case it becomes necessary to reconstruct precinct vote totals or other vital election records.

              " 'Dear Tim, Thanks very much for your email. I greatly appreciate the additional information that you\\'ve given me. I am a bit conflicted about what we should do. IJC published a paper with egregious statistical errors. Douglass et al. was essentially a commentary on work by myself and colleagues - work that had been previously published in Science in 2005 and in Chapter 5 of the first U.S. CCSP Report in 2006. To my knowledge, none of the authors or co-authors of the Santer et al. Science paper or of CCSP 1.1 Chapter 5 were used as reviewers of Douglass et al. I am assuming that, when he submitted his paper to IJC, Douglass specifically requested that certain scientists should be excluded from the review process. Such an approach is not defensible for a paper which is largely a comment on previously-published work. It would be fair and reasonable to give IJC the opportunity to \"set the record straight\", and correct the harm they have done by publication of Douglass et al. I use the word \"harm\" advisedly. The author and coauthors of the Douglass et al. IJC paper are using this paper to argue that \"Nature, not CO2, rules the climate\", and that the findings of Douglass et al. invalidate the \"discernible human influence\" conclusions of previous national and international scientific assessments. Quick publication of a response to Douglass et al. in IJC would go some way towards setting the record straight. I am troubled, however, by the very real possibility that Douglass et al. will have the last word on this subject. In my opinion (based on many years of interaction with these guys), neither Douglass, Christy or Singer are capable of admitting that their paper contained serious scientific errors. Their \"last word\" will be an attempt to obfuscate rather than illuminate. They are not interested in improving our scientific understanding of the nature and causes of recent changes in atmospheric temperature. They are solely interested in advancing their own agendas. It is telling and troubling that Douglass et al. ignored radiosonde data showing substantial warming of the tropical troposphere - data that were in accord with model results - even though such data were in their possession. Such behaviour constitutes intellectual dishonesty. I strongly believe that leaving these guys the last word is inherently unfair. If IJC are interested in publishing our contribution, I believe it\\'s fair to ask for the following: 1) Our paper should be regarded as an independent contribution, not as a comment on Douglass et al. This seems reasonable given i) The substantial amount of new work that we have done; and ii) The fact that the Douglass et al. paper was not regarded as a comment on Santer et al. (2005), or on Chapter 5 of the 2006 CCSP Report - even though Douglass et al. clearly WAS a comment on these two publications. 2) If IJC agrees to 1), then Douglass et al. should have the opportunity to respond to our contribution, and we should be given the chance to reply. Any response and reply should be published side-by-side, in the same issue of IJC. I\\'d be grateful if you and Phil could provide me with some guidance on 1) and 2), and on whether you think we should submit to IJC. Feel free to forward my email to Glenn McGregor.

Last week John McCain was caught talking about Trump\\'s impact on his race, particularly with the Latino community, saying how Trump damages his reelection hopes. But yesterday, in a clear opportunity to buck his party\\'s nominee in regards to the racist comments, McCain stood silent. When asked if he\\'d want Trump to retract his comments made against the Latino community calling them \\'rapists\\' and \\'criminals,\\' McCain said on CNN , \"Oh, I don\\'t know.\" In the meantime, as more Americans favor a Senate vote on Garland\\'s nomination, this weekend Senator Flake talked about why he\\'s playing along with Senate Republicans in holding up Garland\\'s hearing and vote. In an interview with Meet the Press , Flake said \"if we lose the election in November, then we ought to approve him [Judge Garland] quickly because I\\'m certain that he will be more conservative than a Hillary Clinton nomination come January.\" \"John McCain and Jeff Flake can\\'t have it both ways,\" said Arizona Democratic Party spokesman Enrique Gutierrez. \"Either you stand with or stand opposed to Donald Trump.

Reports from South Korean media also claimed that Seal Team 6, the Navy Seal squad who assassinated Osama were simulating drills in which they would take out the North Korean leader Kim . Although the Pentagon would not confirm the reports, they said that \"ground, air, naval and special operations\" are carrying out \"several joint and combined field training operations\" with up to 17, 000 troops.

              " 'The centerpiece of President Barack Obama\\'s climate change strategy faced a key test on Tuesday as conservative appeals court judges questioned whether his administration overstepped its legal authority under an air pollution law to make sweeping changes to the U.S. electric sector. Twenty-seven states led by coal-producer West Virginia and industry groups are challenging the Environmental Protection Agency\\'s Clean Power Plan rules before 10 judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. They argue that the EPA overstepped its regulatory authority under the federal Clean Air Act when the agency issued rules to curb greenhouse emissions mainly from coal-fired power plants. The U.S. Supreme Court has put the regulations on hold while the case is litigated. Tuesday\\'s highly anticipated arguments drew a crowd of hundreds at sunrise to watch the opponents face off against the EPA, 18 states and some supportive power companies. The EPA told the judges that the agency had the power under the Clean Air Act to craft the rule, and that it was cost-effective and achievable. The challengers could face an uphill battle to win over a majority of the 10 judges, six of whom are Democratic appointees. Judge Brett Kavanaugh, appointed by former President George W. Bush, said while he understands the political and moral obligation to address global warming and the importance of the United States to international climate action, the Clean Power Plan\\'s impact on the U.S. economy and on certain coal-reliant communities should require Congress to have a say. \"This is a huge case. It has huge economic consequences,\" said Kavanaugh. He added that climate change does not give the EPA a \"blank check\" to use the Clean Air Act flexibly. Judge Thomas Griffith, another Bush appointee, questioned: \"Why is this (debate) not going-on on the Congress floor but in front of a room full of unelected judges?\" The EPA argued before that the Supreme Court has already given the EPA authority in previous cases to use the section of the Clean Air Act at issue to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Justice Department lawyer Eric Hostetler, representing the EPA, said the agency designed the rule to be cost effective and \"deepen\" the shift already taking place toward cleaner energy. \"The EPA looked at what was going on in the real world,\" he said, noting that most states are already shifting the make-up of their electric generation. In comments indicating support for the government\\'s position, Judge Judith Rogers, appointed to the court by former President Bill Clinton, said the EPA should not close its eyes to trends in the electric sector which have seen utilities diversify their energy mix. \"You can\\'t survive in this market unless you do that,\" she said. Some of the other Democratic appointees voiced similar sentiments indicating they did not think the regulations constituted a major shift as the challengers argue. The Clean Power Plan was designed to lower carbon emissions from U.S. power plants by 2030 to 32 percent below 2005 levels. Power plants are the largest source of U.S. carbon emissions. The Clean Power Plan is the main tool for the United States to meet the emissions reduction target it pledged to reach at U.N. climate talks in Paris last December. The fate of the Clean Power Plan was thrown into question on Feb. 9 when the Supreme Court made a surprise 5-4 decision to grant a request by the challengers to put the rule on hold while the appeals court considered the matter. The eventual appeals court ruling could decide the case, even if it goes to the Supreme Court. The Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia left the court ideologically split with four conservatives and four liberals. A 4-4 ruling by the high court would leave in place the appeals court ruling. The case is being heard by 10 judges rather than 11 because the court\\'s chief judge, Merrick Garland, has recused himself from the case. Garland is Obama\\'s nominee to replace Scalia. A 5-5 ruling would leave the regulations in place. A ruling is unlikely before the end of the year and possibly not until after Obama leaves office on Jan. 20. The outcome of the Nov. 8 presidential election could be pivotal for the regulations. If Republican Donald Trump wins, the government could reverse the rules or decline to appeal to the Supreme Court should the appeals court strike them down. If Democrat Hillary Clinton is elected, the losing side in the appeals court ruling could be expected to take the case to the Supreme Court. If the case does reach the high court, it may not make it in time for the justices to hear it during the court term that begins next Monday and ends in June.',\n",

              " 'Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr  Voter fraud has been on the minds of Republicans for a while now. It has been proven that while yes, there are isolated incidences of in-person voter fraud, there has never been a case where it was so rampant that it changed the results of an election. But that\\'s exactly what the GOP wants you to think is going on.  Donald Trump took Republican rhetoric about voter fraud and has ramped it up to an entirely new level, claiming that the upcoming election is going to be \"rigged.\" Apparently, Republicans are in on this alleged rigging along with Democrats, since a number of the states where the vote looks to be close are controlled by the GOP. And as everyone outside of Trump\\'s basket of deplorables knows, election mechanics are handled by the states, not the federal government.  How are Trump\\'s supporters reacting to all of his claims about voter fraud? Well, in at least one case the answer to that question is \"By committing voter fraud themselves.\"  Terri Lynn Rote, 55, an Iowa Trump supporter, has been charged with \"election misconduct,\" which is a Class D felony in the state. According to Iowa Public Radio, Rote allegedly voted for Trump twice when she cast her ballot during early voting. And her reason? She was afraid that her first vote would be changed to a vote for Hillary Clinton, so she voted again. The Des Moines Register reports that Rote voted once at the Polk County elections office , then again at a county satellite polling location.  Rote told Iowa Public Radio,  \"I wasn\\'t planning on doing it twice, it was spur of the moment. The polls are rigged.\"  According to the Register, Rote\\'s case was one of three voter fraud cases that occurred in Polk County alone. The other two incidents involved people who voted on mail-in ballots, then voted again in person. Polk County auditor Jamie Fitzgerald says this is the first time in his 12 years in office he has had to deal with even one case of voter fraud, let alone three. There are no details about who the other two suspects cast ballots for. The sad thing is, polls have been saying for weeks that Trump is going to win Iowa. Cases like this might put his win there in question, which would be a perfect example of poetic justice.  This is what the rhetoric about voter fraud has come t0 â€” people attempting to vote multiple times because they\\'re convinced that their chosen candidate is going to be cheated out of a legitimate win. Republicans, unwilling to accept that their policies are being rejected by a larger and larger segment of the U.S. population, are trying to sell the message that elections are being stolen from the GOP by \"massive\" voter fraud. Yet, time after time, it seems to be Republicans who are committing the lion\\'s share of it. They claim to love the country, but Trump and the GOP are deliberately undermining the foundation of a democracy â€” the integrity of the vote. Next, Trump will claim that people like Terri Rote are \"political prisoners.\" Just wait for it.',\n",

When I hear from patients and their families about Obamacare, they tell me the law is a broken promise. They couldn\\'t keep the plan they liked. Or the doctor they trusted. Their costs shot up, not down. Jim, a grandfather from Grand Island, Nebraska, says this: \\'Our kids\\' new insurance premiums went up 36 percent, which is over 50 percent of their income â€¦ This leaves my grandkids with no insurance.\\' Tim from Kearney, Nebraska saw his health insurance premium jump 60 percent.

How many of you have seen your health care costs increase? How many of those you know have lost their health care? In November, the American people said, \\'Enough.\\' They asked us to stop the hurt. This week, the Senate answered: we voted to put the tools in place to repeal Obamacare. Now, we will begin the process of putting the American people in charge of their health care. Congress will work with the \\'s administration to put patients and families first â€” not Washington. We will work for a stable transition period to protect families.

              " 'Investors in financial markets, and those predicting faster economic growth in 2017, would do well to remember the famous words that William McChesney Martin Jr. the former Federal Reserve chairman, uttered way back in 1955: The Fed\\'s job is to remove the punch bowl just as the party gets going. Donald J. Trump\\'s promises to cut taxes and regulation and to increase spending on infrastructure and defense have convinced many that a sugar high in the near term will goose the economy. But Fed officials say the economy is already expanding at something close to its maximum sustainable pace, meaning faster growth would drive inflation toward unwelcome levels. To avoid overheating, the Fed could respond by raising interest rates more quickly. The more Mr. Trump stimulates growth, the faster the Fed is likely to increase rates. \"I guess I would argue that I think people have gotten a bit ahead of themselves about what a Trump presidency would mean,\" said Lewis Alexander, chief United States economist at Nomura. \"If we have a big stimulus, the logical thing for the Fed to do is to raise rates faster. There isn\\'t a whole heck of a lot of scope to just let the economy run under those circumstances. There\\'s a big question about whether fiscal stimulus under Trump just leads to higher interest rates. \" Underscoring that question, the Fed is expected to raise its benchmark rate on Wednesday for the first time since last December in light of new economic data. The rate sits in a range of 0. 25 percent to 0. 5 percent, a low level intended to stimulate economic growth by encouraging borrowing and . Analysts predict the Fed will shift the range upward by a quarter of a percentage point, modestly reducing those incentives. The rate increase is widely regarded as a foregone conclusion. The odds, derived from asset prices, topped 95 percent Monday, according to the CME Group. The looming question is how quickly the Fed will continue to raise rates in 2017. Economic forecasts always require large assumptions, but that is particularly true in the present case because Mr. Trump has provided relatively few details about his plans. Perhaps the most accurate thing that can be said about Mr. Trump\\'s victory is that it has increased the uncertainty of the economic outlook. \"At this juncture, it is premature to reach firm conclusions about what will likely occur,\" William C. Dudley, president of the New York Fed, said in a recent speech. During his campaign, Mr. Trump predicted 4 percent annual growth, and his actions since Election Day point to a goal of job creation. \"Our No. 1 priority is going to be the economy, get back to 3 to 4 percent growth,\" Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Trump\\'s pick to serve as Treasury secretary, said last month. Many economists regard such growth predictions as fanciful the economy has been mired in an extended period of slow growth and the reasons, including an aging population and a dearth of innovation, are unlikely to change quickly. Some think Mr. Trump is more likely to push the economy into recession than to catalyze a new boom. Even if Mr. Trump is right, however, the Fed does not want 4 percent growth. The central bank\\'s outlook has become increasingly gloomy. Officials estimated in September that annual growth of 1. 8 percent was the maximum sustainable pace, and they predicted growth would not exceed 2 percent in the next three years. They will update those forecasts Wednesday, but large shifts are unlikely. Fed officials also are increasingly convinced that steady job growth has substantially eliminated the backlog of people seeking work. The unemployment rate fell to 4. 6 percent in November, a level the Fed regards as healthy. For years, Fed officials urged Congress to increase fiscal spending. Now, Mr. Trump is promising to do just that â€” and the Fed has concluded that it is too late. Stanley Fischer, the Fed\\'s vice chairman, said last month the Fed might still benefit from fiscal stimulus because it could raise rates more quickly. That would increase the Fed\\'s ability to respond to future downturns by reducing interest rates. But such gains would come at real cost: A fiscal stimulus would increase the federal government\\'s debt burden, which already is at a high level by historical standards, reducing the room for a fiscal response to a future downturn. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\\'s chairwoman, urged Congress last month to be mindful that the government is already on the hook for more spending as baby boomers age into retirement. \"With the . D. P. ratio at around 77 percent, there\\'s not a lot of fiscal space, should a shock to the economy occur, an adverse shock, that did require fiscal stimulus,\" she said. The tension between fiscal and monetary policy is likely to unfold in slow motion. Mr. Trump has promised to press for rapid changes in government policy, but Congress is not built for speed. A similar effort to cut taxes at the beginning of the George W. Bush administration, for example, was signed into law on June 7, 2001. The impact of new cuts, and any increase in infrastructure spending that Mr. Trump can persuade dubious Republicans to embrace, would be felt mostly in future years. Mark M. Zandi, chief economist at Moody\\'s Analytics, predicted that tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and spending would fuel faster growth in the first half of Mr. Trump\\'s term. But he said that the Fed\\'s rate increases, and restrictions on trade and immigration, would gradually begin to take a larger toll. By the end, Mr. Zandi predicted, the American economy would be \"unnervingly close\" to recession. \"The Fed and markets in general will ultimately wash out any benefit,\" Mr. Zandi said Monday. \"The economy under President Trump ultimately will be diminished. \" Other economists are more optimistic, predicting that the stimulus will not be fully offset by Fed policy. Mr. Dudley appeared to endorse this view in his recent speech, suggesting that the rise in financial markets was \"broadly appropriate. \" Some of Mr. Trump\\'s proposals also could increase the economy\\'s potential growth rate, for example by improving infrastructure or encouraging corporate investment. On the other hand, the Fed\\'s march toward higher rates may be amplified by the bond market. Rates are already rising, and investors concerned about inflation and larger federal deficits are likely to generate persistent upward pressure. Those effects are already visible. Stock prices have climbed since Mr. Trump\\'s surprising victory, increasing the wealth of shareholders. But borrowing costs also climbed. The average rate on a mortgage loan was 4. 13 percent last week, according to Freddie Mac, up from 3. 54 percent just before the election.',\n",

My friend has one of these: http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B0000DI241/  I have about five of these in my home. All have worked well with no problems over the years. However, there is one thing that I would strongly point out. Not all of these dimmer cords have a light on the dimmer box. I accidently got one without the light and it makes it difficult to find in the dark. The light is turned on at the dimmer box and if there is no light on the box to tell you where it is in the dark room, it can be hard to find. This problem is solved if one makes sure that the dimmer box has a small light on it. The second thing that needs to be mentioned is that the outlet plug (into which the lamp plug needs to be inserted) is oriented perpendicular to the wall. If one has a lamp which has a similar outlet plug then with that lamp plug inserted in the dimmer plug which is inserted into the wall, the whole plug component is sticking about 4-6 inches out from the wall. If the outlet plug is behind a bookcase or furniture, this can be a problem. Even with a lamp plug that is flat, it will stick out several inches. Make sure there is enough space between the wall outlet and what is covering this unsightly mix of plugs and cords.\",\n",

Stroebele confirmed the incident in a posting on Twitter. He told ARD that the letter was probably sent by right-wing extremists, even though it was written in Arabic. He gave no explanation.

              " 'The Senate approved complex health care legislation on Wednesday that would increase funding for disease research, address weaknesses in the nation\\'s mental health systems and vastly alter the regulatory system for drugs and medical devices. The vote sealed a final legislative victory for President Obama, who strongly supported the bill against objections from many liberal Democrats and consumer groups. In many ways the bill, known as the 21st Century Cures Act, is a return to a more classic approach to legislation, with policy victories and some disappointments for both parties, and potential benefits for nearly every American whose life has been touched by illness, drug addiction and mental health issues. Years in the making, the measure passed 94 to 5 after being overwhelmingly approved by the House last week. One major winner â€” and a donor to both parties â€” was the pharmaceutical industry its role set off fierce but futile opposition by Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts. On many of the areas addressed by the bill, pharmaceutical companies were in step with the interests of patients desperate for cures, an unusual and emotionally charged alliance between an industry and its consumers. The bill was a test of Ms. Warren\\'s muscle, exercised from the far left of the Senate Democratic caucus, and it is one that did not go well. \"I will fight it,\" she said of the bill last week on the Senate floor, \"because I know the difference between compromise and extortion. \" In the end, however, not a single member of her home state, which has many medical research centers joined her. Nor did anyone else apart from three other senators â€” Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, both of Oregon â€” and Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah. The measure would benefit people with mental illness and chronic diseases, biomedical researchers, pregnant women, hospitals, children with diabetes, people addicted to opioid drugs, children who are bullied, and those who are gravely ill. \"I doubt that there is a family in America who will not be touched by this important legislation,\" said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. In a statement issued after the Senate vote, Mr. Obama said, \"The Cures Act makes important investments that will save lives. \" \"This is a reminder of what we can do when we look out for one another,\" the president said. \"Like Joe Biden and so many other Americans, I\\'ve lost people I love deeply to cancer. I\\'ve heard often from those whose loved ones are suffering from Alzheimer\\'s, addiction and other debilitating diseases. Their heartbreak is real, and so we have a responsibility to respond with real solutions. This bill will make a big difference, and I look forward to signing it as soon as it reaches my desk. \" Mr. Obama has noted that the bill includes money to combat the opioid epidemic, to advance his Precision Medicine Initiative, which aims to collect genetic data on one million American volunteers so scientists can develop treatments, and to support Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \\'s \"moonshot\" to cure cancer. Mr. Biden â€” whose son, Beau, died of a brain tumor last year â€” presided on a procedural vote to move the bill forward in the Senate Monday night, a moving moment for most members of the Senate. While Republicans and Democrats often fight over government spending, the bill benefited from its largess to one agency that has broad support, the National Institutes of Health. \"I don\\'t think there is enough money that we can put into the N. I. H. ,\" said Representative Steve Cohen, Democrat of Tennessee, \"because it is important and it affects all Americans independent of political party, race, sexual orientation â€” you name it. \" The bill gives the health institutes the authority to finance research using special procurement procedures, as opposed to more conventional grants and contracts. It also requires the agency\\'s director to establish \"Eureka prize\" competitions to advance biomedical research and improve treatments for serious illnesses. The bill raises the status of mental health issues by creating a new assistant secretary for mental health and substance use, to be appointed by the president. It directs federal agencies to step up enforcement of laws that require equal insurance coverage for mental and physical illnesses. Federal laws and rules requiring mental health parity have been adopted with bipartisan support over the last 20 years, but a White House task force found recently that compliance was lagging. \"We didn\\'t get everything we needed,\\'\" said Representative Tim Murphy, Republican of Pennsylvania, the architect of provisions to improve the treatment of mental illness, \"but we needed everything we got. \" Major provisions of the bill push the Food and Drug Administration to speed the review and approval of drugs and medical devices. Kim Monk of Capital Alpha Partners, a policy research firm for investors, described the bill as \"a holiday win for much of the health sector. \" Scott Whitaker, president and chief executive of the Advanced Medical Technology Association, a trade group for device makers, hailed the bill for creating \"an expedited pathway for breakthrough medical technologies â€” those that offer the best hope for patients with diseases\" and few treatment options. In reviewing new devices, the bill says, the F. D. A. shall consider the \"least burdensome\" means of showing their safety. In considering whether to approve new drugs or new uses for medications, the bill says, the F. D. A. shall pay more attention to \"patient experience data\" showing the impact of a disease or treatment on patients\\' lives, and their treatment preferences. The legislation does not include provisions to rein in prescription drug prices, a significant victory for the pharmaceutical industry. Consultants to the industry said that drug makers had kept a low profile in their lobbying on the legislation, knowing that any conversations on Capitol Hill could turn quickly to drug prices. \"When the cost of our prescription drugs is skyrocketing, this bill does nothing to combat excessive prices,\" said Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the senior Democrat on the Appropriations subcommittee on health and human services. She voted against the measure. \"While the bill authorizes $4. 8 billion to the N. I. H. over the next 10 years â€” on average, a mere $480 million a year â€” this is barely a quarter per year of what the House passed last year,\" Ms. DeLauro said. \"There is also no guarantee that the appropriators will follow through and provide funding each year. \" Representative Kathy Castor, Democrat of Florida, who voted for the bill, said she too wished that more of the money had been guaranteed. \"Medical research in America today should not be subject to the whims of congressional budget battles or political fights,\" she said.',\n",

              " 'Donald Trump, under pressure to show a more presidential image, elevated a top adviser on Thursday and said he planned to hire additional staff to prepare for the possibility of a long fight for the Republican nomination. The developments came as Trump tries to rebound from a loss in Wisconsin on Tuesday to U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a defeat that punctured the billionaire businessman\\'s aura of inevitability and made it more likely the nominee will be picked in a floor fight at the Republican National Convention in July. The Republican front-runner\\'s stumble in Wisconsin exposed a variety of weaknesses. Trump alienated many female Republican voters by saying that women who have an abortion if the procedure were banned should be punished, a position he later backtracked on. He also appeared to have been outmaneuvered in the scramble for delegates in Louisiana. Although Trump beat Cruz in that state on March 5, Cruz may end up with more delegates from Louisiana than Trump. Trump announced that he has assigned all functions related to the nomination process to veteran political operative Paul Manafort, who was hired to manage the process of corralling delegates who will pick the nominee. \"The nomination process has reached a point that requires someone familiar with the complexities involved in the final stages,\" Trump said. Trump also canceled plans for a campaign swing through California in coming days in order to concentrate on New York, which has suddenly emerged as a must-win state for him on April 19. He has a big lead in his home state. A Trump campaign statement said that he will add to his team as the Republican National Convention nears and that he would announce new hires in the weeks ahead. The expansion of Trump\\'s campaign means his team will grow beyond the close-knit group of advisers who have been at his side since he jumped into the presidential race last June. Trump said he plans to open a Washington office next week. While there has been speculation that Trump might make Manafort his campaign manager, the candidate\\'s statement made clear that current campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and deputy manager Michael Glassner would remain in their positions. Lewandowski has been charged with simple battery for grabbing a reporter who tried to ask Trump a question in Florida a month ago. Trump, famously loyal to people he trusts, has rejected calls that he fire Lewandowski.',\n",

              " 'If ever there was a reminder that Sen. Ted Cruz is NOT the Republican Party s reasonable alternative to Donald Trump, it s in his response to the Brussels terror attacks. Losing badly to Trump, Cruz is clearly feeling the pressure to capitalize on the tragedy to win some crucial votes so he s gone all in on xenophobia, totalitarianism, and religious persecution. A hate cocktail sure to fire up his base.In a statement he released on Facebook, Cruz calls for the establishment of ghettos where America s Muslims can be contained and watched over by a specialized law enforcement group meant to police them. If that sounds a little to Nazi-esque for you, Cruz preemptively accused his critics of just being too politically correct to agree with him.Here s Cruz s terrifying vision for his presidency:We need to immediately halt the flow of refugees from countries with a significant al Qaida or ISIS presence.We need to empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized.We need to secure the southern border to prevent terrorist infiltration.And we need to execute a coherent campaign to utterly destroy ISIS.In other words, Cruz is plagiarizing Trump s ban all Muslims position, but adding that the Muslims already in the country should be secured in specific neighborhoods before they become radicalized. He doesn t bother clarifying how he would hope to accomplish this. Nor does he mention how he could legally target Muslims who had done nothing wrong just because his prejudice tells him they might some day.Being Lying Ted Cruz, he also couldn t help but spread a little misinformation about President Obama as well. Using the president s historic trip to Cuba as a strawman, Cruz bashed him for being on a diplomatic trip while Brussels was attacked, adding that Obama never visited Paris after the terror attacks there. It was an egregious lie, so shameless that a simple picture could debunk it.#COP21 Paying respect : President Obama & French President Hollande lay flowers at Bataclan concert hall in Paris. pic.twitter.com/YEMy7ZUDvk Catherine Field (@CatherineField) November 30, 2015Needless to say, Muslim activist groups, who have watched in horror as hate crimes directed at Muslim Americans has steadily grown thanks to people like Cruz, were not amused by this latest call to trounce the Constitution based on hate and fear. It s really beyond belief that you have one of the leading presidential candidates calling for law enforcement to target religious communities totally based on the fact that they are of a particular faith, CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper said by phone. In normal times, this would be the sort of thing that would disqualify someone from running for dogcatcher, much less president of the United States. We call on voters to reject this.Undoubtedly, terrorism is a serious problem. But the solutions to it need to be much more mature than the Republicans seem to want to believe. Totalitarianism doesn t work and never has. Discriminating against innocent Muslims because of a twisted death cult based in the Middle East is not only doomed to fail, but could backfire in ways that Cruz and Trump can t fathom from their build a wall childish ideology.Between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, it s hard to say who the bigger xenophobic bigot is. Both are consumed by a hatred towards scapegoated groups they hope to exploit in order to ensure people vote for them. At this point in the race, the two Republican frontrunners aren t just mirroring each other s disgusting policies, but actually driving one another to make them more abhorrent. A nuclear arms race of bigotry in a crucial moment in America s history.',\n",

              " 'It was the Spring of 1979. I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school with buck-teeth and freckles. Each day in the cafeteria, I walked from table to table ... Stealing other kids\\' lunch money. No, I didn\\'t rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made them a little deal. \"Let me borrow two dollars today,\" I said, \"and I\\'ll bring you five dollars next week.\" The investment was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes. Of course when \"next week\" rolled around and I couldn\\'t pony up the cash, I promised to pay them even more the week after that, if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer. Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties, and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year\\'s lunch money. I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid, and I didn\\'t even get beat up. Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn. First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You\\'re not going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when you\\'re ahead. Don\\'t wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket. Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind. They are looking out for their own money, not yours. The \"professionals\", those stuffy investment counselors and money managers, will always tell you that the best time to buy is NOW. According to those guys, the longer you keep your money in the market, the more money you\\'re going to make. Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is \"NEVER\". In a sense, they are right. If you put $250,000 in an index fund right now, you\\'ll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years. But here\\'s the problem: Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich? Hell no! You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It\\'s hard to make use of your fortune when you\\'re seventy years old in a wheelchair. If you could make a million dollars in the next few years, what would you do with it? Where would you travel? What kind of car would you buy? The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich. If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility is your ally, and stability your enemy. You want to see those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed by the four hundred point crash a week later. You don\\'t care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long it was UNSTABLE. That\\'s how you\\'re going to make the money. What I\\'m talking about here is day trading. My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years he makes money. The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a $25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade. He acts quickly, taking advantage of all the information at his disposal about a certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or down within hours, sometimes within minutes. I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing amounts of money at it. It\\'s not rocket science, and you only need to learn a few basic principles to get started. Society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training. The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment strategies to make money. Popular media and investment professionals portray successful trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing ring. They don\\'t want the competetion - and they sure as hell don\\'t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm to execute a trade for which they\\'d charge you forty or fifty dollars. They make their money only if you believe two lies: 1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average person. 2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks per trade. Here is what the financial gurus in today\\'s society absolutely, positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ... The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend a few hours of studying. After reading over 200 financial books and publications during the past decade, and after using day trading to successfully make more than four million dollars in the stock market, I\\'ve learned the following lessons: ** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple. ** Anyone can do it. ** It only takes a few hours to learn. When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn\\'t become wealthy overnight. If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through hard work, knowledge, and determination. After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks brought modest gains. The next few months gave me the practical experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk, I had made my first million. The knowledge that I gained during those formative trading years I am willing to share with you in my new book, the Master Trader. You will learn from my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple, secret formula for day trading that I\\'ve used profitably year after year.

Editor in chief Murat Sabuncu, attorney Akin Atalay, correspondent Ahmet Sik and accountant Emre Iper, some of whom have already been detained for 14 months, were ordered to be jailed until the next session of their trial on March 9. Prosecutors say Cumhuriyet was effectively taken over by supporters of Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based cleric blamed by the government for last year s failed coup. The newspaper and staff have denied the charges and say they are being targeted to silence critics of President Tayyip Erdogan. Monday s hearing included drama in court, when the judge ordered Sik removed from the hearing for making political comments. Sik, who wrote a book critical of Gulen s movement at a time when it was an ally of the government, described Turkish authorities as an authoritarian regime dedicated to cruelty , according to the newspaper. After he was ordered out, Sik said the case itself was political. The days will come where you will be tried, do not forget this, he said, according to Cumhuriyet. I hope you won t be tried in a court like yours. The court said the next hearing will be held in Silivri courthouse, the site of a large prison about 60 km (40 miles) west of Istanbul, to ensure security and order. The Turkish authorities have launched a crackdown since the failed 2016 coup, which they blame on followers of Gulen, who denies involvement. More than 150,000 police, teachers, university lecturers, journalists and other professionals have been sacked or suspended from their jobs and 50,000 people have been arrested.',\n",

              " 'Dear Evelyn and Chris, re. proposal review GC04-203, Meko et al. \"A synthesis of 19th century climate data for the United States from paleo, archival and instrumental sources\". I have read the \"Reviewer conflict of interest and confidentiality...\" document and can state that I have no conflict of interest and will abide by the confidentiality provisions etc. I reviewed a very similar proposal by this group 1 year ago, and enclose my review of that proposal below. The new proposal has taken into account my two main concerns from last time, which were: (i) that creation only of a blended data set that contained a time varying mixture of proxy and instrumental data would limit the usefulness because its quality would be time varying, perhaps in an unquantified way, and independent study of errors between proxy and observed data would be prevented; and (ii) that the proposed work was not very innovative in terms of the applications for which the new information would be used. Both of these points have been addressed adequately and so I now rate it \"Excellent (5)\" for scientific/technical merit, and \"High (5)\" for importance/relevance and applicability. One issue that I would like to raise, however, is that the need for quantifying uncertainty/error in the reconstructions/database is not given much coverage in the proposal. It is mentioned, but not focused on. For many applications (testing models, comparison with other reconstructions, detection of unusual climate trends/events), explicitly quantified error estimates are essential. These often change magnitude through time, and thus should be estimated in such a way as to allow this. They may also change with time scale (often being lower for, e.g., a decadal mean than for a single year\\'s value), and again the error estimation method should capture this. I do not think that this issue detracts from the quality of the proposal. Instead I am mentioning it in the hope that this comment can be passed on to the proposers, in the event that the project is funded, so that they can be prompted into placing the appropriate emphasis on quantifying uncertainty. Apologies for being late yet again, and best regards, Tim Date: Thu, 24 Oct 2002 17:14:31 +0000 Subject: confidential assessment of GC03-512 From: Tim Osborn To: CC: , Dear Irma and Chris, Re. proposal review GC03-512, PI: David Meko \"A 19th century data catalog\" First of all, I confirm that there is no conflict of interest etc. Now to my review... (1) Scientific Merit Rating: Good Comments: I completely agree with the rationale behind improving data sets of 19th century climate (see my comments below on \"Relevance to climate change programme\"), and the proposers have identified the most relevant data sources available for the US. The objectives and workplan are generally reasonable, but I have rated it \"good\" rather than \"very good\" or \"excellent\" because it does not seem as scientifically innovative or challenging as it might. Some particular concerns are highlighted below. I am very wary about the proposed approach of integrating the data sources together to produce a single climate product. Obviously the data sources have to be used in combination, for calibration of proxy data or for assessment of possibly dubious early instrumental data, *but* combining them all into a single product only will be very restrictive for future use, assessment, improvements. Much better would be to produce intrumental-only series for whatever length is available, and tree-ring only series for the full length (i.e., into the late 19th and 20th centuries, despite the availability of instrumental data for these periods). Blending them into a single analysis is of some, but limited, use and comparisons of different periods and with (e.g.) model simulations can only ever be done by taking into account error bars that vary dramatically in time and are only estimates of the \"true\" errors - and the error estimates may be underestimates if based only on residuals or covariances during the 20th century. No mention is made of using the 19th century data to consider key issues such as difference between tree-ring and ground borehole temperatures (they differ more in the 19th century, in terms of trend, than in other centuries), possibly taking into account land-use change. No mention is made of using the 19th century data to assess multi-century temperature reconstructions and why they differ. These are issues of great importance. No mention is investigating seasonal dependence of temperature changes, which are greater in existing temperature products during the 19th century than in the 20th century and which has important implications for the calibration of proxy (including tree-ring) data against summer or annual data and the need to more clearly define the true seasonal response of proxy data. Despite these concerns, the proposed work is certainly worthy of funding and the extra items of interest that I mention above could be achieved using the data generated here, in some future project. (2) Relevance to climate change programme Rating: High Comments: The 19th century is certainly of particular importance, not just for the reasons outlined in the proposal but also because this century shows some of the biggest disagreements in warming trend between various quasi-hemispheric temperature reconstructions and between proxy and instrumental data and between different seasons of instrumental data. Additional data sources are definitely required, and additional digitisation, homogenisation and intercomparison of data sets is necessary. For these reasons, work such as that proposed here is essential for helping to refine answers to questions such as how unusual is late twentieth century climate and detection of climate change signals against the noise of natural climate variability.

              " \"Wednesday morning, Donald Trump started his day off just like any normal bizarre despot, with tweets celebrating the world s fear and outrage at his nuclear threats toward North Korea. He retweeted Fox & Friends on Twitter no less than three times for their breathless coverage of his manly escapades. But in the middle of his bluster, Trump forgot once again that the internet is a forever place, where no facts are ever lost, except to the swirling vortex of a Trump supporter s mind.Perhaps he was relying on that very fact that his supporters will believe anything he says when he made a claim about his first order as president. In a pair of tweets continuing the theme of the day, Trump asserted that he was responsible for the modernization of our nuclear program:My first order as President was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal. It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before . Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 9, 2017 Hopefully we will never have to use this power, but there will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 9, 2017Unfortunately for Trump, he s wrong on two counts. Not only was that not his first order that was on Obamacare but it wasn t even him that began the renovation and modernization process. That would be the guy before him. Ben Rhodes, the former foreign policy adviser to Barack Obama, was quick to point out Trump s lie:It's literally impossible for Trump to have changed our nuclear arsenal in 6 months. Alarming thing to lie about. https://t.co/9cizhVLJAU Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) August 9, 2017So we all have to rally around the leader because he decided to threaten North Korea with nuclear destruction. Get ready for more of this. https://t.co/P5STDMVWMy Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) August 9, 2017Boasting about the size of our nuclear arsenal and sending aides out to demand we rally around the leader is chilling. And it's only month 7 Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) August 9, 2017It s not the first time Trump has lied about things he s done, and it certainly won t be the last. But the fact that this is a lie about nukes makes it a little more alarming and indicates that Trump truly doesn t understand the gravity of the situation. Already, we re seeing reports from aides saying that Trump wasn t actually serious in making his nuclear threats. But this isn t something to be taken lightly.What s more, there s plenty of reason to be concerned about the very first thing Trump did do regarding our nuclear arsenal, in case anyone s forgotten. He put a guy he beat in the primary by calling him a dumbass in charge of it.\",\n",
              " \"Tom, Good idea with that BAMS paper. There is also the KNMI web site, which tells that they have restricted data from Europe - on the ECA part. Both despite WMO-Res40! On IPCC, I suggested Thomas to not get too many hangers on amongst the LAs. Chs 2 and 14 are prime candidates for upping the geographic spread. We had about half of ours not doing that much last time. Isn't Tom Karl on the US nominating committee? Away all day tomorrow - CRU barbecue - so will pour down. Cheers Phil At 17:07 29/07/2009, you wrote: Hi, Phil, Yes, Friday-Saturday I noticed that ClimateFraudit had renewed their interest in you. I was thinking about sending an email of sympathy, but I was busy preparing for a quick trip to Hawaii - I left Monday morning and flew out Tuesday evening and am now in the Houston airport on my way home. Data that we can't release is a tricky thing here at NCDC. Periodically, Tom Karl will twist my arm to release data that would violate agreements and therefore hurt us in the long run, so I would prefer that you don't specifically cite me or NCDC in this. But I can give you a good alternative. You can point to the Peterson-Manton article on regional climate change workshops. All those workshops resulted in data being provided to the author of the peer-reviewed paper with a strict promise that none of the data would be released. So far as far as I know, we have all lived up to that agreement - myself with the Caribbean data (so that is one example of data I have that are not released by NCDC), Lucie and Malcolm for South America, Enric for Central America, Xuebin for Middle Eastern data, Albert for south/central Asian data, John Ceasar for SE Asia, Enric again for central Africa, etc. The point being that such agreements are common and are the only way that we have access to quantitative insights into climate change in many parts of the world. Many countries don't mind the release of derived products such as your gridded field or Xuebin's ETCCDI indices, but very much object to the release of actual data (which they might sell to potential users). Does that help? Regarding AR4, I would like to be part of it. I have no idea what role would be deemed appropriate. One thing I noticed with the CLAs in my old chapter is that if one isn't up to doing his part (too busy, or a different concept of timeliness, or ...) it can make for a difficult job. You and I have worked well together before (e.g., GSN) so I'd be delighted to work with you on it and I know you'd hold up your side of the tasks. We touched on this briefly at the AOPC meeting. If I get an opportunity, I would say yes. But I also don't know what the U.S. IPCC nominating approach would be or even who decides that. There is an upcoming IPCC report on extremes and impacts of extremes and I wasn't privy to any insights into the U.S. nominations other than when it was over it was announced in NCDC staff notes that the nominations had been made. However, Kumar had earlier asked if he could nominate me, so he did (I provided him with the details). Regards, Tom Tom, If you look on Climate Audit you will see that I'm all over it! Our ftp site is regularly trawled as I guess yours is. It seems that a Canadian along with two Americans copied some files we put there for MOHC in early 2003. So saying they have the CRU data is not quite correct. What they have is our raw data for CRUTEM2 which went into Jones and Moberg (2003) - data through end of 2002. Anyway enough of my problems - I have a question for you. I'm going to write a small document for our web site to satisfy (probably the wrong word) the 50 or so FOI/EIR requests we've had over the weekend. I will put up the various agreements we have with Met Services. The question - I think you told me one time that you had a file containing all the data you couldn't release (i.e. it's not in GHCN). Presumably this is not in your gridded datasets? Do you know off hand how much data is in this category? Would NCDC mind if I mentioned that you have such data - not the amount/locations/anything, just that there is some? On something positive - attached is the outlines for the proposed Chs in AR5/WG1. Ch1 is something Thomas thinks he can write himself - well with Qin Dahe, so only 13 chapters. There are a lot of issues with overlaps between some of the data chapters 2 with 3, 2 with 5 and 2 with 14. I'm still thinking about whether to get involved. It would be 2 if I decide. At the moment I'd say yes, but I might change my mind tomorrow! Nominations are from Nov09 thru Jan10 with the selection made in April 10. Are you considering getting involved? I have got the IPCC Secretariat and Thomas to raise the FOI issues with the full IPCC Plenary, which meets in Bali in September or October. Thomas is fully aware of all the issues we've had here wrt Ch 6 last time, and others in the US have had.

But Facebook, the world\\'s largest social media network, has come up with its own determination of your political leanings, based on your activity on the site. And now, it is easy to find out how Facebook has categorized you â€” as very liberal or very conservative, or somewhere in between. Try this (it works best on your desktop computer): Go to facebook. on your browser. (You may have to log in to Facebook first.) That will bring you to a page with your ad preferences. Under the \"Interests\" header, click the \"Lifestyle and Culture\" tab. Then look for a box titled \"US Politics. \" In parentheses, it will describe how Facebook has categorized you, such as liberal, moderate or conservative. (If the \"US Politics\" box does not show up, click the \"See more\" button under the grid of boxes.) Facebook makes a deduction about your political views based on the pages that you like â€” or on your political preference, if you stated one, on your profile page. If you like the page for Hillary Clinton, Facebook might categorize you as a liberal. Even if you do not like any candidates\\' pages, if most of the people who like the same pages that you do â€” such as Ben and Jerry\\'s ice cream â€” identify as liberal, then Facebook might classify you as one, too. Facebook has long been collecting information on its users, but it recently revamped the ad preferences page, making it easier to view. The information is valuable. Advertisers, including many political campaigns, pay Facebook to show their ads to specific demographic groups. The labels Facebook assigns to its users help campaigns more precisely target a particular audience. For instance, Donald J. Trump\\'s presidential campaign has paid for its ads to be shown to those who Facebook has labeled politically moderate. Campaigns can also use the groupings to show different messages to different supporters. They may want to show an ad to their supporters, for example, that is unlike an ad targeted at people just tuning in to the election. It is not clear how aggressively Facebook is gathering political information on users outside the United States. The social network has 1. 7 billion active users, including about 204 million in the United States. Political outlook is just one of the attributes Facebook compiles on its users. Many of the others are directly commercial: whether you like television comedy shows, video games or Nascar. To learn more about how political campaigns are targeting voters on social media, The New York Times is collecting Facebook ads from our readers with a project called AdTrack.

              " 'One can only imagine what kind of relationship Hillary has with her very close top aide s soon to be ex-husband Fox News Sunday reported this morning that Anthony Weiner is cooperating with the FBI, which has re-opened (yes, lefties: re-opened ) the investigation into Hillary Clinton s classified emails. Watch as Chris Wallace reports the breaking news during the panel segment near the end of the show:https://youtu.be/x13hBwS9q2cAnd the news is breaking while we re on the air. Our colleague Bret Baier has just sent us an e-mail saying he has two sources who say that Anthony Weiner, who also had co-ownership of that laptop with his estranged wife Huma Abedin, is cooperating with the FBI investigation, had given them the laptop, so therefore they didn t need a warrant to get in to see the contents of said laptop. Pretty interesting development. Targets of federal investigations will often cooperate, hoping that they will get consideration from a judge at sentencing. Given Weiner s well-known penchant for lying, it s hard to believe that a prosecutor would give Weiner a deal based on an agreement to testify, unless his testimony were very strongly corroborated by hard evidence. But cooperation can take many forms and, as Wallace indicated on this morning s show, one of those forms could be signing a consent form to allow investigators to review the contents of devices that they could probably get a warrant for anyway. We ll see if Weiner s cooperation extends beyond that.',\n",

              " 'in: Medical & Health , Multimedia , Natural Medicine , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests Cannabis contains a compound that may kill brain cancers that chemotherapy and radiation can\\'t touch, so why isn\\'t it being used today? In recent years, we\\'ve focused heavily on educating our readers about the still relatively unknown role that cancer stem cells play in cancer, both in terms of conventional cancer treatment failure and the exceptionally promising role that natural interventions play in targeting these highly malignant cells. It is encouraging to witness a growing awareness that cancer has been completely misunderstood , and that in order to make progress against the global epidemic we will have to go back to the wisdom of the ancients by using foods and spices instead of toxic chemicals and radiation to fight a disease that should be classified more as a survival mechanism unmasked than an inexorably lethal, genetically-driven condition . Even the National Cancer Institute now admits that it had been wrong for decades about \"early stage\" breast ( DCIS ) and prostate (HGPIN) \"cancers,\" and that they should be reclassified as indolent or benign lesions of epithelial origin, i.e. not \"cancer\" at all! Essentially, therefore, millions were overdiagnosed and overtreated for cancers they never had. Even now, despite this admission, the vast majority of conventional doctors have yet to account for, acknowledge, or integrate this radically different definition of cancer and its implications for treatment into their \"standard of care.\" Only last week, we featured a new review on natural therapies that target cancer stem cells , many of which included common foods and spices. You can view it here. But one substance conspicuously absent from the list was cannabis , which is the herb we now turn to to give it a fair representation in the context of this topic. A recent article published in the Journal Neuroimmune Pharmacology titled, \" The Antitumor Activity of Plant-Derived Non-Psychoactive Cannabinoids ,\" reviewed the therapeutic potential of a non-psychoactive class of phytochemicals found in cannabis known as cannabinoids . Unlike THC, cannabinoids do not activate the cannabinoid 1 and cannabinoid 2 receptors in the central nervous system in any significant way, making their activity less controversial as they do not produce changes in perception and sensation associated with \"recreational\" and/or \"psychedelic\" drugs. There are actually over 60 cannabinoids in cannabis, but the second most abundant one, cannabidiol (CBD), has been found to inhibit and/or kill a wide range of cancers in the animal model, including gliobastoma (a difficult-to-treat type of brain cancer), breast, lung, prostate, and colon cancer. There have been a wide range of mechanisms identified behind these observed anti-tumor activities, including anti-angiogenic (preventing new blood vessel formation), anti-metastatic, anti-cell viability, but the one we wish to focus on in this report is its ability to to inhibit the stem-like potential of cancer cells. Stem cells are unique within the body as they are capable of continual self-renewal, theoretically making them immortal relative to regular body cells (somatic cells), which die after a fixed number or replication cycles. In their normal state of function they are essential for healing and bodily regeneration, as they are capable of differentiating into the wide range of cells that make up the body and need to be regularly replaced when damaged. This so-called pluripotent property of stem cells is also observed in tumor formation and maintenance, as cancer stem cells are capable of producing the entire range of different cells that make up a tumor colony. Unlike regular tumor cells, cancer stem cells are uniquely tumorigenic because they are capable of breaking off from an existing lesion or tumor and forming a new tumor colony of cells. In this sense, they are \"mother cells\" at the heart of cancer malignancy, whose ability to colonize other tissues by producing all the \"daughter cells\" necessary to form a new tumor make their existence highly concerning from the perspective of cancer prevention and treatment. Radiation and chemotherapy, while capable of reducing the size of a tumor, actually enrich the post-treatment residual lesion or tumor with higher levels of cancer stem cells , and in some cases transform non-cancer stem cells into cancer stem cells , ultimately making the post-treatment state of the treated tissue far worse than its pre-treatment condition. This is why identifying and using natural, safe, effective and affordable ways to target cancer stem cells versus the non-tumorigenic tumor cells in a lesion or tumor is the only rational way to treat cancer, and should be the primary focus of present day cancer treatment approaches. The new review discussed the way that cannabidiol targets and/or inhibits the cancer stem cell subpopulation in cancers such as the highly treatment-resistant form of brain cancer known as glioblastoma, which is widely considered by conventional medicine as \"incurable.\" A 2013 study, 1 mentioned in the review, found that patient-derived glioblastoma cells when exposed to cannabidiol saw a significant down-regulation of the genetic tumor marker Id-1, which has been closely correlated with brain cancer cell invasiveness. They also found that cannabidiol was capable of inhibiting neurosphere formation (a sign of cancer stem cell tumor formation), as well as was capable of inhibiting glioblastoma tumor invasiveness in an animal model. The results of this preclinical study were so compelling that the researchers concluded cannibidiol might make an ideal adjunct treatment: With its lack of systemic toxicity and psychoactivity, cannabidiol is an ideal candidate agent in this regard and may prove useful in combination with front-line agents for the treatment of patients with aggressive and high-grade glioblastoma tumors. Integrative approaches often focus on using natural interventions as \"adjuncts\" to conventional, inherently toxic approaches like chemotherapy and radiation, we believe that another possibility exists, namely, that cannabidiol in combination with a wide range of other natural substances studied for targeting glioblastoma is more effective (and certainly far safer) than a combination approach. To view other anti-glioblastoma substances, view our database on the subject . Another highly relevant study published in 2007 titled, \"Cannabinoids induce glioma stem-like cell differentiation and inhibit gliomagenesis,\" 2 found that cannabinoids target the stem-like properties of glioma cells, encouraging their differentiation into functioning, non-tumorigenic cells, and inhibiting the dysregulated increased production of glioma cells. A more recent 2015 study, 3 found that glioblastoma cells treated with cannabidiol inhibited their self-renewal by down-regulating \"critical stem cell maintenance and growth regulators.\" Another study, published last month, found that cannabidiol inhibits glioma stem-like proliferation by inducing autophagy, a natural form of programmed cell death. 4 Consider, finally, that the cancer stem cell targeting and killing properties of cannabidiol are only one of a wide range of potential mechanisms through which cannabis as a whole plant, comprised of hundreds of different phytochemicals and phytonutrients, can treat cancer. We have indexed hundreds of studies on cannabis\\' therapeutic properties, a good subset concerning its ability to prevent, kill, or regress a wide range of different cancer types. You can view them all on our cannabis research database . Research on cannabis and brain cancer has only just begun, but considering the abject failure if not also sheer violence of conventional approaches, waiting for sufficient quantities of Pharma or government capital to flow in the direction of a non-patentable substance already saddled with archaic laws in some cases criminalizing its possession is a no win proposition. Anecdotes of healing with cannabis are not uncommon. One such report can be viewed on our colleague Dr. Jeffrey Dach\\'s website, titled, \" Cannabis Oil Brain Tumor Remission ,\" demonstrating just how powerful cannabis and its cannabinoids may be for accomplishing what conventional approaches can not. A couple years ago, we reported on a similar case of temporary remission in childhood leukemia using cannabis extract . Also, consider reports like this one, where a woman clearly being victimized by conventional medicine was able to replace 40 different medications through using raw cannabis juice . The short of it is that the future of medicine , if it is to continue to advertise itself to be concerned with alleviating human suffering and being guided by \"evidence,\" must incorporate this safe, time-tested, affordable and effective healing agent into its standard of care. Failing to do so will not de-validate cannabis, rather, but the medical system itself. One might ask, if cannabis can treat \"incurable\" brain cancers, and is safer and more effective than chemotherapy and radiation, shouldn\\'t withholding it or information about its healing properties be considered criminal? Instead we still live in a time and age where simply possessing it or using it is in some jurisdictions classified as a criminal offense of dire if not irreparable consequence to our civil liberties. Perhaps we are at a critical turning point now and the aforementioned research will lead us all forward to a more enlightened medical ethos that respects the right of a patient to choose his or her treatment as long as it does no harm to others.

              " 'Trump Campaign missed the deadline to remove William Johnson as a delegate [Media preview] ________________________________ From: Sarge, Matthew Sent: Tuesday, May 10, 2016 8:35 PM To: Comm_D Subject: Mother Jones: Trump Campaign Corresponded With Its White Nationalist Delegate Long After \"Database Error\" Trump Campaign Corresponded With Its White Nationalist Delegate Long After \"Database Error\" On Tuesday, Mother Jones broke the story that the Trump campaign had selected William Johnson, a prominent white nationalist leader, as a California delegate. The Trump campaign responded with the following statement: Yesterday the Trump campaign submitted its list of California delegates to be certified by the Secretary of State of California. A database error led to the inclusion of a potential delegate that had been rejected and removed from the campaign\\'s list in February 2016. Reached again by Mother Jones late Tuesday, Johnson said he would resign as a delegate if asked to do so by the campaign. \"I accept Trump\\'s explanation,\" he said, regarding the statement. \"I don\\'t want to gainsay the Trump campaign. If I am not removed from the database, I will resign.\" Although the Trump campaign blamed a \"database error\" for including Johnson as a delegate, the campaign corresponded with him personally just over 24 hours ago. Trump\\'s California delegate coordinator, Katie Lagomarsino, sent Johnson a congratulatory email on Monday, and when he asked for clarification about how to send his completed pledge form back to the campaign, she replied. Here is the email exchange (with the personal contact information redacted by Mother Jones): [ Mother Jones also has a copy of the pledge form discussed in the email exchange, which Johnson signed and sent to the Trump campaign on Monday. You can see his pledge here . ________________________________ From: Sarge, Matthew Sent: Tuesday, May 10, 2016 4:04 PM To: Comm_D Subject: Mother Jones: Trump Selects a White Nationalist Leader as a Delegate in California h/t Joel We have a fair amount on William Johnson and his Pro-Trump American National Super PAC running robocalls in Iowa Trump Selects a White Nationalist Leader as a Delegate in California On Monday evening, California\\'s secretary of state published a list of delegates chosen by the Trump campaign for the upcoming Republican presidential primary in the state. Trump\\'s slate includes William Johnson, one of the country\\'s most prominent white nationalists. Johnson applied to the Trump campaign to be a delegate. He was accepted on Monday. In order to be approved he had to sign this pledge sent to him by the campaign: \"I, William Johnson, endorse Donald J. Trump for the office of President of the United States. I pledge to cast ALL of my ballots to elect Donald J. Trump on every round of balloting at the 2016 Republican National Convention so that we can MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" After he signed, the Trump campaign added his name to the list of 169 delegates it forwarded to the secretary of state. Johnson leads the American Freedom Party, a group that \"exists to represent the political interests of White Americans\" and aims to preserve \"the customs and heritage of the European American people.\" The AFP has never elected a candidate of its own and possesses at most a few thousand members, but it is \"arguably the most important white nationalist group in the country,\" according to Mark Potok, a senior fellow for the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which tracks hate groups. Johnson got the news that he had been selected by Trump in a congratulatory email sent to him by the campaign\\'s California Delegate Coordinator, Katie Lagomarsino. \"I just hope to show how I can be mainstream and have these views,\" Johnson tellsMother Jones. \"I can be a white nationalist and be a strong supporter of Donald Trump and be a good example to everybody.\" Johnson says that in his application to be a GOP delegate for Trump he disclosed multiple details about his background and activism, though he did not specifically use the term \"white nationalist.\" The Trump campaign and Lagomarsino did not respond to requests for comment. Whether or not Johnson was vetted by the Trump campaign, the GOP front-runner would have a hard time claiming ignorance of Johnson\\'s extreme views: Johnson has gained notice during the presidential primary for funding pro-Trump robocalls that convey a white nationalist message. \"The white race is dying out in America and Europe because we are afraid to be called \\'racist,\\'\" Johnson says in one robocall pushed out to residential landlines in Vermont and Minnesota. \"â€¦Donald Trump is not racist, but Donald Trump is not afraid. Don\\'t vote for a Cuban. Vote for Donald Trump.\" Armed with cash from affluent donors and staffed by what the movement considers to be its top thinkers, the AFP now dedicates most of its resources to supporting Trumpâ€”and for good reason: Johnson claims the AFP\\'s pro-Trump robocalls, which have delivered Johnson\\'s personal cellphone number to voters in seven states, have helped the party find hundreds of new members. \"[Trump] is allowing us to talk about things we\\'ve not been able to talk about,\" Johnson says. \"So even if he is not elected, he has achieved great things.\" On numerous occasions, Trump has failed to forcefully repudiate this sort of support. After being endorsed by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke in August last year, Trump simply told Bloomberg News, \"I don\\'t need his endorsement; I certainly wouldn\\'t want his endorsement. I don\\'t need anybody\\'s endorsement.\" Asked in February about the robocalls, which are funded by Johnson through a super-PAC, a Trump spokeswoman would only tell CNN that the candidate had \"disavowed all super-PACs offering their support.\" The SPLC\\'s Potok argues that Trump has \"legitimized and mainstreamed hate\" in ways we haven\\'t seen since the days of George Wallace. Though nobody can say for sure how many people belong to America\\'s largest hate groups, the SPLC has found that the number of such groups grew by 14 percent in 2015, reversing years of declines. Potok worries that Trump could fuel the spread of the AFP\\'s ideas for years to come. Johnson is a corporate lawyer who grows persimmons and raises chickens at his 67-acre \"ranch\" in a Los Angeles suburb. When I met him recently outside his law office in downtown LA\\'s World Trade Center, he was in high spirits. He suggested brightly that we walk downstairs to get lunch at a nearby Korean restaurant. As we sat next to a table of immaculately coiffed Korean Air flight attendants, I mentioned that some might find it surprising that a guy who wrote a book advocating the creation of an all-white ethno-state was eating a plate of bulgogi beef with kimchee. \"Koreans don\\'t have to make Korean food,\" he said matter-of-factly. \"One of the best Chinese restaurants I went to in the Bay Area is owned by a Mormon and cooked by a Mormon. Really great Chinese food.\" Short, graying, and 61 years old, Johnson favors pressed white shirts and bookish black-framed glasses. He grew up in predominantly white neighborhoods in Arizona and Oregon before moving to Japan in 1974 to study the language. It was there that locals engaged him in \"open\" discussions about differences between the races, and he came to see America\\'s European heritage as its biggestâ€”and most vulnerableâ€”asset. (This trajectory is not uncommon: Jared Taylor, head of the white nationalist group American Renaissance, also speaks fluent Japanese, and Aryan Nations founder Richard Butler became a white supremacist while immersed in the caste system in India.) In 1985, Johnson published, under a pseudonym, Amendment to the Constitution: Averting the Decline and Fall of America, a book calling for the abolition of the 14th and 15th Amendments and the deportation of all nonwhites. He tried to sound a practical tone, allowing, for instance, that African Americans should receive \"a rich dowry to enable them to prosper in their homeland.\" The book was a hit on the talk show circuit, and Johnson suddenly found himself appearing on television alongside neo-Nazi skinheads and Klansmen. By 1989, his notoriety and clean-cut appeal convinced a group of white nationalists in Wyoming to tap him to run for Dick Cheney\\'s vacant congressional seat. He garnered a flurry of press coverage when he earned enough signatures to qualify for the ballot; around the same time, the building housing his California law office was bombed. Johnson says the FBI accused him of detonating it himself in a bid for more press. (The bureau declined to comment.) Twenty years later, after unsuccessfully running for various other offices, Johnson became the head of the American Freedom Party (then known as American Third Position), at the request of a group of Southern California skinheads. Johnson\\'s post was supposed to be temporary: \"The skinheads thought I was too extreme to run the organization,\" he explained. But they were the ones who ended up dropping out, replaced by what has become a sort of white nationalist brain trust: Party leaders now include a former Reagan administration appointee and a professor emeritus at California State University-Long Beach. After our Korean lunch, Johnson rushed back up to his office to host the latest episode of For God and Country, a Christian AM talk show currently broadcast in California, Louisiana, and Texas. His Filipino American co-host, the Rev. Ronald Tan, nodded approvingly as Johnson praised Trump on the air for \"busting up the concept of political correctness.\" The show allows Johnson to push a Trump-centric version of white nationalism to a potentially receptive audienceâ€”up to a point. Several radio stations in Iowa recently canceled the program out of objection to its content. During a commercial break, Johnson fidgeted. \"Are you going to quote any more Scriptures?\" he asked Tan nervously. \"Has the station said that we\\'re not Christian enough?\" Back on the air, Tan pivoted to 1 Samuel 16, comparing Trump to King David. In addition to promoting Trump on the radio and over the phone, the AFP streams a podcast called the Daily Trump Phenomenon Hour. It has set up a \"political harassment hotline\" for Trump supporters who wish to consult with an attorney about being attacked or verbally abused by anti-Trump protesters. Johnson has personally spent $30,000 the Trump promotions, including $18,000 for the party. The robocalls, the radio show, and the \"harassment hotline\" were all things that Johnson mentioned in his application to become a Trump delegate. He specifically cited an anti-Romney robocall commissioned in Utah this past March, which begins, in part, \"My name is William Johnson. I am a farmer and a white nationalist.\" After wrapping up the radio show, Johnson led me through his office, where a brush-painted screen hangs alongside shelves stacked with Japanese books and dictionaries. Many of his legal clients, it turns out, are foreigners who speak English as a second language. Yet Johnson says he sees no problem with Trump\\'s isolationist foreign policy, even if it hurts his businessâ€”ideally, he\\'d like to give up his practice and serve as Trump\\'s secretary of agriculture. We ended up in a mirrored conference room to meet with three AFP sympathizers, two middle-aged women and a young man. They talked about how Trump had enabled a new kind of \"honest discourse,\" how he wasn\\'t a racist but a \"racialist,\" and how he had left them feeling \"emancipated.\" Johnson also now finds it easier to be himself: \"For many, many years, when I would say these things, other white people would call me names: \\'Oh, you\\'re a hatemonger, you\\'re a Nazi, you\\'re like Hitler,\\'\" he confessed. \"Now they come in and say, \\'Oh, you\\'re like Donald Trump.\\'\"',\n",

You should also be interfacing with your counterparts in CE / Political to make sure they are engaged and helping with the lift â€“ can also be a broader discussion about preparing lists / comms plans for the general. Thanks all From: demcommunications@googlegroups.com On Behalf Of Walker, Eric Sent: Wednesday, May 11, 2016 9:13 AM To: demcommunications@googlegroups.com Subject: [COMMUNICATIONS] Press events re: this week\\'s Trump/Ryan meeting Hey everyone â€“ Tomorrow, Donald Trump is coming to Washington D.C. to meet with Paul Ryan, Reince Priebus, and Mitch McConnell. The Ryan meeting is the highlight because Ryan has withheld his endorsement of Trump thus far. This is an ideal opportunity to highlight the historic mess that is the Republican Party, with the Speaker of the House of Representatives not ready to fully endorse his Party\\'s nominee, and a slew of former GOP presidential candidates, former Republican presidents and vulnerable Senate and House candidates trying to distance themselves from their standard bearer. We\\'re asking state party communications directors to put together events around Thursday morning\\'s Trump-Ryan meeting to deliver the message that while Trump and Ryan may have a personal disagreement, they are both pushing the same divisive and dangerous agenda. We\\'re also asking state party communications directors to echo these events with op-eds and letters to the editor in local papers, and surrogates on television and radio. Attached please find a packet with materials to put together an event. In this packet you\\'ll find: Â· Sample talking points / message guidance Â· A sample advisory Â· A sample press release Â· A sample op-ed Â· Four sample letters to the editor DNC can offer national surrogates to appear via satellite or phone on local television and radio broadcasts to amplify the message. Please reach out to walker@dnc.org if you would like to book one of our surrogates. Members of Congress and Senators who are currently in Washington can also use our studio to do local hits. Here\\'s what we\\'re looking for in terms of event logistics: Â· Types of speakers: o State Party Chairs, Vice-Chairs, and EDs o Local Elected Officials o Allied Groups â€“ Planned Parenthood, NAACP, Mi Familia Vota, etc. o Labor o People sharing personal stories Â· About 15-20 supporters Â· Signs that say \"Reject the Trump-Ryan Agenda\" â€“ we have a mockup that can be found here . Â· A big push to get local TV to the event â€“ studies show that local TV is the dominant player in most markets and Americans trust local TV news about 20 points more than they trust national TV news. The Republican Party has elevated offensive policies and extreme voices using divisive campaigns for years, and now they\\'re stuck with Donald Trump\\'s reckless and dangerous campaign heading into the general election. We have to make sure we hold Republicans in Congress and in every state accountable for their Party\\'s dysfunction as they chaotically tumble toward the general election. And while Republicans argue, Democratic voters are overwhelming in agreement that our primary has been exciting, and large majorities would support either one of our candidates. This meeting is also a reminder that what Trump has promised and what Republicans up and down the ballot have pushed for is the same brand of trickle-down economic policies that help those at the top while costing hardworking Americans. It\\'s the same old Republican playbook of cutting taxes for the rich at the expense of middle-class families, opposing measures like equal pay and paid family leave, and reckless policies that would only to drag America back into a recession . We can\\'t afford to go back to losing 800,000 jobs a month as the last Republican president left office.

If you re elected president are you going to take military action against Iran? O Reilly asked. Are you going to do something to that country? Well, I would want to help Saudi Arabia, Trump replied with what seems to be a reference to Iranians attacking the Saudi Arabian embassy in retaliation against a mass execution the Saudis recently committed on New Year s Day in which 47 were killed, including a Shiite cleric. I would want to protect Saudi Arabia, Trump claimed. But Saudi Arabia is going to have to help us economically Trump suggested that he might attack Iran if Saudi Arabia offered the right price but remained largely unwilling to say one way or another whether he would get America involved in yet another costly and bloody war in the Middle East.O Reilly continued to press Trump for an answer, calling him out for dodging the question.Trump then went on a tirade against the Iran nuclear deal, calling it a disastrous deal that Iran has already supposedly broken before claiming that Iran will have a nuclear weapon very soon. Clearly, Trump is not aware of the fact that Iran recently surrendered their entire stockpile of enriched uranium to the Russians, which is definitive proof that the Iran nuclear deal is a success because it is doing exactly what it was designed to do.The Iran nuclear deal stands as one of President Obama s greatest achievements, and should not be abandoned in favor of war when diplomacy is working. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia is nothing more than ISIS posing as a legitimate nation. They use Sharia law and behead so many people every year that ISIS leaders must be envious. The only reason our government has failed to call the Saudis out for their horrible human rights record is because they control the second largest oil reserves in the world.This is why it is not only important for the United States to reject military action in the Middle East, we need to become energy independent so that we no longer have to rely on Saudi Arabia for our energy needs. Frankly, the United States government should grow a pair and strongly condemn Saudi Arabia right now for behaving like a terrorist organization.The bottom line, however, is that Donald Trump is unfit to be commander-in-chief. He not only wants to send American troops to die needlessly in Iran, he wants to make Saudi Arabia pay for it. Basically, Trump would turn America into a puppet for the Saudis. But more likely, he would damage relations with both nations and put America squarely in the middle of a potential conflict that could easily turn into World War III.America does not need more war. We need peace. And as O Reilly pointed out, voters have the right to know what Trump plans to do, even if Trump thinks they have no right to know at all.Here s the video via YouTube.',\n",

              " 'I almost gave this a 5 star review, but as much as I WANTED to, I just couldn\\'t quite for one reason - the buttons. To give a bit of background, I have a great room that has only four recessed cans in the ceiling to light the whole room. To along the peak of the ceiling, and two down one slope over the fireplace. The controls for the two main ones are in a bank with the switches for the hallway and the kitchen, right in my traffic pattern. The controls for the two on the other edge of the room are next to the fireplace, the exact opposite side of the room. So those don\\'t get used too often, despite how useful they can be sometimes. So lighting has been a real pain in here, especially as I bounced from one type of light to another trying to find something that worked well. The main ones that are always on after sundown are LED\\'s now, nice 6k units that brighten up the area I\\'m in just fine. But often when my son and I are building Lego or Megablok sets, we need the other lights after sunset since the two main just don\\'t provide enough light. That\\'s about the only time I usually turn on the others. I thought if I had a remote for them, I\\'d be more likely to use them when needed for other things. This is my third or fourth try to get some kind of wireless control for this location. The others were just too bulky to fit within the \"standard\" box the builders used here for the wall switch. This is the first that fit, and it didn\\'t even have to be crammed in there. It came with the three wire connectors to hook it up to the wires from the walls, and they were large enough to cover the stripped part of the copper on the existing wires, but not so large as to be too bulky to shove behind the box of the dimmer. The wall plate is two pices, the one piece with screws that screws to the actual switch hardware, then a plate that snaps into place over that, so this plate DOES stick out from the wall more than a standard wall plate does, noticeably more. Installation took me all of 6 minutes from start to finish, including two trips to the basement to turn the circuit off and back on. The remote comes unsynchronized, so you have to sync it with the switch. Easy enough, hold OFF on the wall switch for 10 seconds or so, then do the same on the OFF switch on the remote. It works well. I like the dimming up it does for the bulbs when turned on, and that it dims off as well, rather than just instant brightness or darkness. The \"favorite\" raised button on the remote is handy if you have a preferred setting you want to use most of the time, The remote is responsive and accurate - I\\'ve not had any misfires. Now the reason I took a star off - the buttons. I really hate the feel of them. There\\'s a button centered in the undersized buttons, and they roll all around it, in all directions. So it always feels like it\\'s about to come loose or something. They tilt all around that center pivot point if you hit one of the edges. The other downside is that there is no \"favorite\" or \"last\" setting for the wall switch itself. I had installed the MACL-153M-WH switch for my mom at her condo, and that\\'s just the single button, feels better, and remembers a favorite setting from just the wall switch. This one doesn\\'t have the same functionality unfortunately. My other wishlist item would\\'ve been that it have an LED somewhere for easy finding in the dark. But the LED\\'s are only on if the light is on. The whole \"raised icon\" to \"easily find in the dark\" really seems pretty useless to me - if you\\'ve already got your hands on the switch and can feel the raised icon, clearly you\\'ve ALREADY found the switch... Apparently the CFL\\'s I had in the cans were not dimmable, since as soon as I turned this on, they just started blinking on and off. This wouldn\\'t even work with them as a simple on/off switch. But that was good, it gave me the excuse to buy some better LED\\'s, as these were the only cans left that I hadn\\'t swapped to LED yet. But as I said, this is the first switch I\\'ve tried at home that fit my switch box in the wall. It works very well, despite my lack of enthusiasm for the buttons.',\n",

              " 'In her standard stump speech, Hillary Rodham Clinton talks about fighting income inequality, celebrating court rulings on gay marriage and health care, and, since the Emanuel AME Church massacre, toughening the nation\\'s gun laws. That last component marks an important evolution in presidential politics. For at least the past several decades, Democrats seeking national office have often been timid on the issue of guns for fear of alienating firearms owners. In 2008, after Barack Obama took heat for his gaffe about people who \"cling to guns or religion,\" he rarely mentioned guns again â€” neither that year nor in his 2012 reelection campaign. But in a sign that the political environment on guns has shifted in the wake of recent mass shootings â€” and of Clinton\\'s determination to stake out liberal ground in her primary race against insurgent Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) â€” Clinton is not only initiating a debate about gun control but also vowing to fight the National Rifle Association. \"I\\'m going to speak out against the uncontrollable use of guns in our country because I believe we can do better,\" Clinton said Tuesday in Iowa City. A few days earlier, she said in Hanover, N.H.: \"We have to take on the gun lobby. . . . This is a controversial issue. I am well aware of that. But I think it is the height of irresponsibility not to talk about it.\" Clinton\\'s comments could stoke millions of politically active gun owners, and Wayne LaPierre, the NRA\\'s executive vice president, argued that the move was fraught with peril for her. \"We\\'ve been down this road before with the Clintons,\" \\xadLa\\xadPierre said through a spokesman. \"She needs to read her husband\\'s book.\" In his memoir, \"My Life,\" former president Bill Clinton suggested that his vice president, Al Gore, lost the 2000 presidential election in part because of backlash in states such as Arkansas and Tennessee over the Clinton administration\\'s 1995 ban on assault weapons, which has since expired. Many Democratic lawmakers also lost their elections after gun-control votes. The Republican 2016 presidential candidates, in keeping with GOP orthodoxy, have spoken out loudly against gun control. Many gave speeches at the NRA\\'s spring convention and tout their high ratings from the group. Mark Glaze, a longtime gun-control advocate who until recently oversaw former New York mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\\'s gun-control efforts, argued that Hillary Clinton should embrace her husband\\'s record. \"The Clintons pulled off the almost-impossible by giving us the background-check system and banning assault weapons,\" Glaze said. \"That\\'s something President Obama wasn\\'t able to do. Their political interest lies in owning, rather than obscuring, that accomplishment.\" Many Democratic strategists said campaigning on guns is smart politics for Hillary Clinton both in the primary and, should she become the nominee, in the general election. Gun control is one of the few issues on which Clinton has a more left-leaning record than Sanders, who represents a rural, pro-gun-rights state and has voted in the past for legislation to protect the firearms industry. Although Clinton has not attacked Sanders by name, by invoking guns she makes an unspoken contrast. The issue also fits neatly into the overall narrative Clinton is trying to present. She can stake out a bold stance on an issue that plays well with the liberal base while arguing that she would break through the partisan stalemate in Washington. There are few issues more in\\xadtrac\\xadtable than guns. In 2013, after the massacre of 20 young children and six educators at an elementary school in \\xadNewtown, Conn., a bipartisan compromise to expand background checks for firearm purchases failed to pass the Senate despite overwhelming popular support and President Obama\\'s backing. Clinton began talking about gun control in the days following last month\\'s church shooting in Charleston, S.C., and aides said she plans to keep it in her stump speech, although she has no immediate plans to unveil a detailed gun policy. \"This is an important issue, and she believes that we cannot let partisan gridlock prevent us from continuing to seek \\xadcommon-sense safety measures,\" said Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon. Despite his mixed voting record, Sanders did support the 2013 background-check bill and \\xadassault-weapons ban. And on the stump, he is trying to sound more forceful. He notes that \"guns in Chicago and Los Angeles mean a very different thing than guns in Vermont and New Hampshire\" but says â€” as he did two weeks ago in Bow, N.H. â€” that the next president must \"come forward with a common-sense proposal on guns.\" In the Democratic field, former Maryland governor Martin O\\'Mal\\xadley has the strongest record in favor of gun control. He supported an assault-weapons ban as mayor of Baltimore in the early 2000s and then signed one into law as governor in 2013, along with a suite of gun restrictions that stand as among the nation\\'s toughest. \"He\\'s the only person in the race who\\'s led on this issue,\" said O\\'Malley spokeswoman Haley Morris. Looking to the general election, some gun-control measures are popular, especially with the coalition of swing-state Latinos, African Americans, and young and suburban women the Democratic nominee would need to win the White House. \"There is no more powerful force in an election than the suburban mother, and you don\\'t find a lot of suburban mothers that are against some sort of common-sense gun control,\" said Mo \\xadElleithee, a former Clinton adviser and Democratic strategist who now directs the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service. Other Democrats argue that Clinton has nothing to lose. Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (D-Va.) said the NRA has become a \"paper tiger,\" noting the elections he\\'s won despite the NRA\\'s vocal opposition. \"I think she has no illusion that even if she didn\\'t say a word about guns, the NRA would be out there blasting her to say she had a conspiratorial plan to work with the U.N. to take everybody\\'s guns away, so why not go head-on on an issue that will improve safety,\" Kaine said. A survey this year by the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research found that 89 percent favor requiring background checks for all gun sales, including 85 percent of gun owners. But polling is much more closely divided on other gun restrictions and does not account for the high intensity among gun-control opponents. David \"Mudcat\" Saunders, a Democratic strategist based in conservative rural Virginia, warned that Clinton\\'s focus on guns could taint the entire Democratic ticket, including candidates for state and local offices. \"Never in the history of the Democratic Party have they started a gun debate that didn\\'t cost them numbers in the general election,\" said Saunders, who supports the candidacy of former senator Jim Webb (D-Va.). \"She\\'s trying to get to the left of Bernie, obviously, but I think it\\'ll hurt her in the long run â€” and it\\'ll cost anybody on the down ticket in the South and in rural America.\" In her 2008 presidential campaign, Clinton stayed nearly silent on guns. An exception was after Obama\\'s \"cling to guns\" comment surfaced, when she attacked him as being \"elitist\" and fondly recalled her father teaching her to shoot as a little girl at her grandfather\\'s Pennsylvania lake house. Howard Wolfson, for many years a top Clinton aide before going to work for Bloomberg, said Clinton\\'s avoidance of guns in 2008 should not be mistaken for a lack of interest in gun control. \"I started working for her back in 1999 and she talked about it back then,\" Wolfson said. \"As a senator from New York, it was something that was important to her. I think in the wake of Newtown and Charleston, it\\'s more resonant in our political culture.\" In recent months, Clinton\\'s speechwriters and policy staff have sought counsel from Bloomberg\\'s group, Everytown for Gun Safety. Erika Soto Lamb, \\xadEverytown\\'s spokeswoman, said Clinton\\'s focus on the issue is \"striking.\" \"Knowing how hard we tried in 2012 to get [Republican nominee Mitt] Romney or Obama to say something about guns,\" she said, \"it is a changed world now when Hillary and other candidates are making it a part of their stump. This is the first presidential election when we\\'ve seen proactive statements.\" Jose DelReal in Iowa City and Scott Clement in Washington contributed to this report.',\n",

              " 'by Dr. Mercola  A new federal report revealed that the majority of U.S. adults (more than 54 percent) had some type of musculoskeletal pain disorder such as back, joint or neck pain in 2012 (the latest year for which statistics are available). [1]  Its prevalence is indicative of the significant price Americans pay for pain â€” it\\'s a leading cause of disability and major contributor to health care expenses and disability compensation.  Also revealing, people suffering from pain were significantly more likely to have used a complementary health approach compared to people without pain â€” nearly 42 percent versus 24 percent, respectively.  The reason wasn\\'t addressed by the study, but time and again, conventional medicine fails to relieve many people\\'s pain.  Congressional testimony from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) stated that Americans consume 80 percent of the pain pills in the world, [2] and in a survey of more than 2,000 pain patients in the U.S., most said they were taking a dangerously addictive opioid pain medication. [3]  Research suggests, however, that these drugs work for only about three months, after which changes in your brain may lead to increased feelings of pain along with added emotional upset, including feelings of hopelessness and desperation. [4]  Many pain sufferers have tried virtually every treatment that conventional medicine has to offer â€” medications, injections, surgery and more â€” only to find that their pain hasn\\'t gotten better and they may be struggling with treatment-induced side effects as well (one of the worst of which is opioid addiction ).  At that point (and for many far sooner), it\\'s only natural that you would begin to seek other options, which brings many people to holistic, complementary or \"alternative\" health care options for relief. Science-Backed Natural Pain Relief Options  A recent study published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings evaluated several complementary approaches for pain relief. [5] The options that follow have been scientifically proven to help with relief, according to the report.  Acupuncture  One of the most common uses for acupuncture is in treating chronic pain. One analysis of the most robust studies available concluded that acupuncture has a clear effect in reducing chronic pain, more so than standard pain treatment. [6]  Study participants receiving acupuncture reported an average 50 percent reduction in pain, compared to a 28 percent pain reduction for standard pain treatment without acupuncture. It\\'s likely that acupuncture works via a variety of mechanisms.  In 2010, for instance, it was found that acupuncture activates pain-suppressing receptors and increases the concentration of the neurotransmitter adenosine in local tissues [7] (adenosine slows down your brain\\'s activity and induces sleepiness).  Massage Therapy  A systematic review and meta-analysis, published in the journal Pain Medicine, included 60 high-quality and seven low-quality studies that looked into the use of massage for various types of pain, including muscle and bone pain, headaches, deep internal pain, fibromyalgia pain and spinal cord pain. [8]  The review revealed that massage therapy relieves pain better than getting no treatment at all.  Relaxation Techniques  Breathing exercises, guided imagery, meditation and other relaxation techniques may provide relief, especially from pain from tension headaches and migraines.  Research by an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, Dr. Herbert Benson, found that people who practice relaxation methods such as yoga and meditation long-term have more disease-fighting genes switched \"on\" and active, including genes that protect against pain and rheumatoid arthritis. [9]  Exercise  Among people who had experienced back pain , those who exercised had a 25 percent to 40 percent lower risk of having another episode within a year than those who did no exercise. [10]  Strength exercises, aerobics, flexibility training and stretching were all beneficial in lowering the risk of back pain.  Motor control exercises (MCE), which help to improve coordination of muscles that support your spine,11 may also help. One systematic review found MCE led to reductions in pain and disability and improvements in perceived quality of life compared with minimal intervention. [12]  Yoga , which is particularly useful for promoting flexibility and core muscles, has also been proven to be beneficial if you suffer from back pain.  People suffering from low back pain who took one yoga class a week had greater improvements in function than those receiving medicine or physical therapy. [13] The Yoga Journal has an online page demonstrating specific poses that may be helpful. [14]  Medical Marijuana  There are cannabinoid receptors in your brain, lungs, liver, kidneys, immune system and more. Both the therapeutic and psychoactive properties of marijuana occur when a cannabinoid activates a cannabinoid receptor.  Research is still ongoing on just how extensive their impact is on our health, but to date it\\'s known that cannabinoid receptors play an important role in many body processes, including metabolic regulation, cravings, pain, anxiety, bone growth and immune function. [15]  Some of the strongest research to date is focused on marijuana for pain relief. In one study, just three puffs of marijuana a day for five days helped those with chronic nerve pain to relieve pain and sleep better. [16]  Also revealing, in states where medical marijuana is legal, overdose deaths from opioids like morphine, oxycodone and heroin decreased by an average of 20 percent after one year, 25 percent after two years and 33 percent by years five and six. [17] Turmeric for Pain Relief  Turmeric was once most known for being a flavorful and colorful addition to curry, but in the scientific world, turmeric has earned a reputation for being a multi-faceted healer. Turmeric contains curcumin, which has notable anti-inflammatory properties.  It can inhibit both the activity and the synthesis of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) and 5-lipooxygenase (5-LOX), as well as other enzymes that have been implicated in inflammation.  A 2006 study found that a turmeric extract composed of curcuminoids (curcumin is the most investigated curcuminoid) blocked inflammatory pathways, effectively preventing the launch of a protein that triggers swelling and pain. [18]  Turmeric has been found to significantly improve post-operative pain and fatigue, [19] and in a study of osteoarthritis patients, those who added only 200 milligrams (mg) of curcumin a day to their treatment plan had reduced pain and increased mobility.  Time magazine even published the story of one doctor who marveled at one of his older hip patient\\'s lack of pain and remarkably swift recovery from surgery. The patient took turmeric regularly, and the results so impressed the physician that he began taking the supplement himself. [20] Essential Oils for Pain Relief  Essential oils are concentrated, aromatic plant extracts that have been used for thousands of years for emotional, cosmetic, medical and even spiritual purposes. One of their most popular uses is also for relief of chronic and acute pain.  There are a number of ways to use essential oils , including via aromatherapy. Lavender aromatherapy, for instance, has been shown to lessen pain following needle insertion [21] while green apple scent significantly relieves migraine pain . Other essential oils noted for pain relief, including relief from joint pain, include: [22] Lavender',\n",

              " 'HAZLETON, Pa. â€” Thousands of Dominicans have poured into this little city in eastern Pennsylvania since 2001 to work in the food plants and warehouses on the edge of town, where the highway to New York meets the highway to Philadelphia. Hazleton\\'s population is growing for the first time in more than half a century. Landlords, doctors and shopkeepers are learning to love their new customers. But the city\\'s economic evolution has left behind its previous, working class, and the presidential election has crystallized its frustrations. Many of those losing ground economically, including lifelong Democrats, say they plan to vote for Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee. Many of those who are prospering, including lifelong Republicans, say they will vote for the Democrat, Hillary Clinton. For both sides, how to deal with immigration has become a defining political issue, one that is likely to transcend the contretemps over Mr. Trump\\'s treatment of women that has cost him so much support among elected Republicans. This city was built by European immigrants who flocked here a century ago to work in the coal mines. Their children found better jobs in the factories. Now their grandchildren are struggling against economic decline and cultural displacement. \"I don\\'t care for this town no more because of the Hispanics,\" said Lewis Beishline, 70, as he sat drinking at 11 a. m. on a Friday at Cusat\\'s Cafe, a bar owned by the mayor of Hazleton, who lives upstairs. Mr. Beishline, a retired welder, said he moved from Hazleton to a nearby town last year because he no longer felt safe. He plans to vote for Mr. Trump, he said, \"because of the immigration. \" The Hispanic community, meanwhile, is eager to establish its own political power in the face of what many describe as persistent and painful discrimination. Community leaders in this city of 25, 000 say they have registered more than 800 Hispanic voters in recent months, expanding the voting rolls by almost 10 percent. \"I tell my kids, if someone asks where you are from, you say \\'Hazleton,\\'\" said Guillermo Lara, 49, who moved here from Mexico in the early 1990s and whose two daughters were born here. \"We\\'re here, and we don\\'t go nowhere. We want more. \" That sharp divide is mirrored by the candidates seeking the Oval Office. Beyond his promised wall and deportations, Mr. Trump has denigrated immigrants repeatedly, at times without distinguishing between legal and illegal immigration. \"Donald Trump\\'s position on illegal immigration plays a big role in his support not only in Hazleton but in northeast Pennsylvania,\" said Lou Barletta, a Republican who represents the region in Congress and has stood by his nominee as other Republicans in Congress have fled. In 2006, as Hazleton\\'s mayor, Mr. Barletta championed a ordinance penalizing employers and landlords for dealing with illegal immigrants. The courts blocked it from taking effect, but Mr. Barletta said Mr. Trump\\'s popularity reflected the continued demand for stronger government action. \"He\\'s going to win here, and win big,\" Mr. Barletta said. Mr. Barletta introduced Mr. Trump at a rally in nearby on Monday night, declaring that voters in northeastern Pennsylvania would propel Mr. Trump to the White House. Mrs. Clinton, by contrast, has celebrated immigrants, both legal and illegal, as important contributors to American society. Her campaign describes her plan to create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants as one of her most important ideas for increasing economic growth. \"Comprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy and keep families together â€” and it\\'s the right thing to do,\" Mrs. Clinton said in accepting the party\\'s presidential nomination in Philadelphia, about 100 miles southeast of Hazleton. The Hispanic population grew faster in Luzerne County, which includes Hazleton, than almost any other county between 2000 and 2011, according to the Pew Research Center. While immigration has slowed since the 2008 recession, Hispanics continue to move here from larger cities like New York and Paterson, N. J. In the 2000 census, just 4. 9 percent of Hazleton\\'s population identified as Hispanic. A decade later, that figure was 37 percent. By 2014, the most recent data available, 46 percent of the population said it was Hispanic. In all likelihood, Hazleton is now a city, just like the nearby cities of Reading and Allentown. The Hispanic ascendence emerged from seismic economic shifts, said Jamie Longazel, a professor of sociology at the University of Dayton who grew up just outside Hazleton and wrote a book, \"Undocumented Fears,\" about the city\\'s struggles with immigration. When the local coal mines began to close in the 1950s, Hazleton residents raised money to build an industrial park that attracted factories to the region. When the factories began to leave in the 1990s, the city mobilized again. Local officials won state permission to create one of Pennsylvania\\'s largest Keystone Opportunity Zones. A Cargill meat processing and distribution plant arrived in 2001. Other distribution businesses have followed, including an Amazon. com warehouse. Many residents claim that city officials advertised for immigrant labor on billboards in New York or New Jersey, but Mr. Longazel said there was no evidence that ever happened. The truth is that the immigration was unanticipated but most likely inevitable. \"The new jobs don\\'t pay as much as the old jobs did, and the reality is that folks were just not interested,\" Mr. Longazel said. The city also was also aging. Almost a quarter of the population was over 65 in 2000, roughly twice the national average. And nature abhors a vacuum â€” especially in a work force. Many of the new arrivals trace their roots to one Dominican city, San JosÃ© de Ocoa. Hazleton\\'s old shopping streets, nearly abandoned in the 1990s, are now lined with Dominican bakeries, barbershops, travel agencies and Mexican restaurants. The Italian restaurants are now run by Mexican families. The city has two Spanish radio stations and a television station that broadcasts six hours of local programming a day. Stephen M. Schleicher, a dermatologist, said Hispanic residents now made up a third of his patients. He has hired a bilingual receptionist and is looking for a bilingual nurse. He has started placing ads in the local newspaper. Dr. Schleicher, a lifelong Republican, said that Mr. Trump\\'s views on immigration had persuaded him, albeit reluctantly, to vote for Mrs. Clinton. \"We\\'re seeing a total revitalization despite the government trying to keep the immigrants out,\" he said. \"It would have been a ghost town of older white people. \" Yet it is easy to overstate Hazleton\\'s recovery. Many of the new jobs pay poorly. Almost 29 percent of the population lived in poverty in 2014, almost twice the national average. And Hazleton\\'s evolution has inspired deep resentment. Many residents complain bitterly about the new arrivals not speaking English, about loud music late at night, about people walking in the street and driving without regard for traffic rules. Wana Bostic, 45, scrapes by on $11. 50 an hour as a home health aide. She said that she was not paid nearly enough, but that employers can squeeze workers because of the ready availability of immigrant labor. \"No one talks about white Americans and what we really need,\" she said. Crime has increased, as has drug use. The police force, meanwhile, has shrunk with declining tax revenue. Many residents are convinced that illegal immigration is to blame. \"If you come into the country breaking the law, that\\'s not a good way to get your foot in the door,\" said Nick Zapotocky, 31, who now has three deadbolt locks on the door of his home. \"That says you\\'re willing to break the law again. \" He voted for President Obama in 2008. In 2012, he did not vote. And this year, he said he will vote for Mr. Trump. Francisco said people were blinded by their fear of change, unable to see the benefits that immigration is bringing to Hazleton. Mr. whose father was Mexican, runs a company that makes caps for old wells. He employs 30 people in the summer, only a few of them Hispanic. And he noted that some of the largest employers in the area are now Mexican companies, including Bimbo Bakeries, which has a plant nearby that makes millions of Thomas\\' English Muffins. Mr. said he had always voted Republican, loyal to his pocketbook. But he plans to vote for Mrs. Clinton, he said. \"They fear they\\'re losing what they remember,\" he said. \"But what can you do? The United States is in evolution. Apple pie came after the Germans arrived. Maybe it will now be \\'As American as salsa.\\' So what?\" Hazleton still has no Hispanic elected officials. The city just added its first Hispanic police officer. The public school system, which has very few Hispanic teachers, was ordered by the federal Department of Education in 2014 to improve efforts to teach English to immigrants, and to communicate with parents. But a second generation of Hispanic Americans in Hazleton may force change. Mr. Lara worked three jobs to pay private school tuition so his daughters could avoid Hazleton\\'s high school. After days in a factory, he washed dishes at night and cleaned offices on weekends. Two years ago, his eldest daughter, Amanda, graduated from Ithaca College in upstate New York with a degree in psychology and came home. She teaches classes for Hispanic children in the building that was once her elementary school. It has become a community center thanks in large part to Joe Maddon, a Hazleton native who manages the Chicago Cubs. Ms. Lara, who is studying for a master\\'s degree at the University of Scranton, said racial tensions had increased. At the city\\'s annual Funfest, she noticed an empty space between the Hispanic vendors and the Polish and Italian vendors. \"And I hear it from my kids,\" she said of her students. \"They\\'re not dumb. They can tell when they\\'re not liked or they\\'re not welcome. \" But she said she was not sure she wanted to move away. \"People say, \\'Why would you want to stay there? \\'\" she said. \"Well, for one thing, this is my hometown. \"',\n",

MSNBC contributor Eddie Glaude asked Murphy what he believes the animating commitment behind the GOP health care bill is and what it would take for him to work in a bipartisan way with Republicans to fix the country s health care system. At this point, I think it s clear the animating commitment is a hatred of Barack Obama, Murphy said. The policy has been pushed to the wayside here. They don t seem tremendously interested in actually crafting something that insures more people or reduces rates. They just want to fulfill this commitment that they made to repeal Obamacare. Murphy went on to say that he has made it very clear he wants to compromise with Republicans on health care. They want, as far as I can tell, flexibility of benefit design. They want something that has some cheaper premiums, less regulations in these exchanges. I m willing to talk to them about that, Murphy said.

They usually cater and pander to a group of people who they think will have the best chance at casting a vote in their favor. In the case of Republican presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz, those he s decided to cater to are the residents of Idiot America.Cruz has decided to go all in trying to get the ultra-religious, absent from reality, guns and God group of folks who love to hunt, hate gay people and live far away from populated areas. People otherwise known as extreme, right-wing Republicans.Perfectly pandering to this demographic, Cruz paired himself up with Duck Dynasty and their bigot-in-chief Phil Robertson. Robertson is about as anti-gay and bigoted as one could ever hope to be, so of course he s now endorsed one of the leading bigot candidates running for president Ted Cruz.In a new campaign commercial for Cruz, Robertson, with his face painting black camo for hunting, tells everyone the qualifications he wants to see in a president: Is he or she godly? Does he or she love us? Can he or she do the job? And finally, would they kill a duck and put em in a pot and make up a good duck gumbo? I ve looked at the candidates. Ted Cruz is my man. (Let s just pause for a second and acknowledge that Robertson said he or she. Got to at least give credit where credit is due)Now, as far as Cruz being the man for the job of President of the United States? Yeah, not so much. He s a smarmy man who will say or do anything to get his way. This includes, but is not limited to, likely not even being as religious as he says he is, or as constitutional as he claims to be.Cruz tends to do things for show, and no greater example of this can be seen than in this very commercial where he puts on blackface, pardon me, hunting camo paint that looks remarkably like blackface and someone should have told him that, and sits down to hold his gun and hunt with Robertson.Cruz is all like, Look at me! I m just like you! I like to hunt and play make-believe Rambo, too! Ignore the fact that I m insanely wealthy and married to Goldman Sachs! Vote for me! He knows exactly what he is doing. He s a smart guy, gotta give him that much, which also makes him irrefutably dangerous. He knows how to play the game, get what he wants, and he doesn t seem to care who might get hurt along the way.However, this ad right here, as funny as it may be, because it s pretty goddamn funny, also show to the depths he ll go to cater to a specific voter population.

              " \"An atheist group has found a truly genius way to troll christian conservatives over their $101m Noah s Ark being built in Kentucky by crowdfunding mock billboards for the christian theme park. Author and columnist Dan Arel writes in Pathos that a group called the Tri-State Freethinkers are raising $2,000 to place billboards which name the Ark Adventure Genocide and Incest Park. Image via IndiegogoThe Indiegogo page for the project states:The billboards are likely to serious annoy the Ark Adventure team, who have lurched from one crisis to another in their attempts to set up the site.Australian-born Creationist Ken Ham and his fundamentalist Christian organization Answers in Genesis (AiG) are looking to build a $101m Ark Adventure in Kentucky, with the centerpiece of a reconstructed Ark. The problem is, they want you the taxpayer to pay for it.According to Newsweek, AiG purchased a 99-acre plot of land just outside Williamstown, Kentucky got the city for just a dollar five years ago. But since then, the project has hit one hurdle after another. Many, of Ham s own making.The principal issue at stake now, is that Ham and AiG want the taxpayer to pick up the bill for around a quarter of the construction costs of the project in the form of tax rebates. The group sought to exploit subsidies provided by the state to boost tourism through the Tourism Development Incentive program. Projects of $1 million and upwards can recover 25% of project development costs by recouping their sales taxes.After much debate on their initial application, Kentucky approved the site for the scheme so long as AiG agreed to non-discriminatory hiring practices. This means, they could only recover the cash if they recruited people of all faiths and none. They could not specifically hire Creationists.A few bumps down the road later, and Ham and AiG had to significantly strip back their pans for the park. They were unable to gather together the funds and investment to create the full theme park. Due to the substantial changes to the plans, they had to resubmit their application to Kentucky for the tax rebate. This time is was denied. Why? Because apparently, honesty and integrity mean nothing to this group of creationists.Despite their reluctant agreements to get their hands on state cash, AiG had released a decidedly discriminatory recruitment policy for the Ark Adventure. The website demanded a salvation testimony and a creationist statement of faith from all prospective job applicants clearly ruling out non-believers.So now, Ken Ham and AiG are suing Kentucky for the money claiming religious discrimination. Greg Lipper, senior litigation counsel for Americans United for Separation of Church and State points out the muddled-thinking that AiG is applying in this case. AiG is confusing what they have the right to do as a private organization with what taxpayers are required to fund, They re saying Kentucky taxpayers should pay for them to expand a religious ministry. That kind of argument would make Thomas Jefferson turn in his grave. No one is telling Ham as a private citizen, who or how he can hire. It is only as a recipient of state funds, an agreement which he is free to enter or not, that he is required to follow the stipulations that would be applied to any organization or individual doing the same. Just like chances of his theory of genesis being true, Ham s chances of getting his lawsuit through are slim to none.And his Ark hasn t escaped the attention of social media users either I just realised that America's immigration policy doesn't weed out Australian Ark Building Lunatics. #kenham Michael (@gotapulse) January 3, 2016If #KenHam could get a 500 yr old dude & his kids to build the Ark themselves w/o modern technology I would give the park more credit. Uncle John (@azmoderate) January 18, 2016If the universe was capable of giving Ken Ham and his cohorts a sign that their project was doomed to failure, this comedy of errors and public embarrassments would be it.\",\n",

              " 'White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney said on Monday he expects the Treasury secretary to use extraordinary cash management measures after the government\\'s current debt ceiling extension expires on March 15. \"The secretary of the Treasury actually makes the decision and I expect him to do what all previous secretaries of the Treasury have done, at least all the ones that I\\'m familiar with, to use those measures to extend that date,\" Mulvaney said in an interview on Fox News. \"But we will deal with it,\" he said, \"certainly\" before Congress recesses in August. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at his Senate confirmation hearing last month that he would like to see an increase in the debt ceiling \"sooner rather than later\" to avoid another standoff with Congress that could upset financial markets. The United States is one of few nations in which the legislature must approve periodic increases in the legal limit on how much money the federal government can borrow. Rather than setting a specific dollar limit on the debt, Congress in 2015 simply suspended the ceiling until March 15, allowing normal borrowing to continue. The debt ceiling will reset at the total debt level outstanding on that day, but Congress will need to approve a new debt ceiling or extension. As of Feb. 23, the federal debt stood at about $19.88 trillion, according to Treasury data. But analysts estimate that Treasury can continue to borrow and avoid a payment default for several months past March 15 even with no action from Congress as it deploys its extraordinary cash management measures. In the past, the Treasury has been able to stave off depletion of its cash reserves with steps such as temporarily halting investments in some pension funds for federal workers and suspending sales of certain securities to state and local governments. Although such steps are known as \"extraordinary measures,\" they are routinely used by Treasury during debt ceiling debates. In 2011, Standard & Poor\\'s downgraded the U.S. credit rating for the first time after a gridlocked Congress waited until the government was possibly within hours of defaulting on its debt to raise the ceiling.',\n",

Importance: High * * * * * NOTE: PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING... * * * * * With ECS (Enron Center South) rapidly approaching completion, Enron is forced to change the numbering scheme on the existing Stentofon system. To increase our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid Stentofon address numbers. Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 and 900 series numbers for the addresses. In order to add more addresses to the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system. This conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th. In efforts to minimize the number of times each user will change their number, we will be converting all Stentofon addresses in EB1 that are scheduled to move into ESC this year to a 5000 series number. (i.e. If your Stento number was 364, then your new number will be 5364.) We will also change all speed dials to reflect the new dialing scheme. Please instruct the users within your group of this change. All Enron Broadband Stentofons will have their numbers changed to a 4000 series number. (i.e. If your Stento number was 576, then your new number will be 4576.) In summary, all Stentofon numbers will be changing this weekend. If you are scheduled to move into ECS, then your Stento number will begin with a '5' and if you are to remain at EB1, then your Stento number will begin with a '4'. Please inform all users of the Stentofon System of this change and pass this information to anyone that needs it. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

              " 'Alabama Governor Robert Bentley said on Thursday he would not resign after the state\\'s ethics commission found probable cause that he violated ethics and campaign finance laws, a ruling that could result in criminal charges. The second-term Republican governor faces a hearing in separate proceedings on Monday that could lead to his eventual impeachment and ouster. The probable cause findings by the Alabama Ethics Commission prompted Republican Del Marsh, the leader of the state Senate, to call on Bentley to step down, local media reported. Marsh said the governor was not able to lead effectively. Bentley faces escalating political fallout over his relationship with a former senior adviser and has been dogged for the past year by questions concerning his potentially inappropriate use of state resources. Asked for a response to Marsh\\'s comments, Bentley said in a statement: \"I have no intentions of resigning and I am looking forward to continuing to work on important issues facing the state.\" The Alabama House of Representatives\\' Judiciary Committee will begin the impeachment process on Monday, said its chairman, Representative Mike Jones. \"It\\'s time to put this in front of us, let\\'s address it, and let\\'s get it behind us,\" Jones said on the floor of the House on Thursday. The committee will make a recommendation to the full House on whether to impeach Bentley. The judiciary committee has been conducting its own investigation apart from the ethics commission and plans to issue a report on Friday. Bentley denies any legal wrongdoing. \"We think there is not a basis that the governor violated any law,\" his lawyer, Bill Athanas, told reporters Wednesday night. \"So the battle goes on.\" After allegations of a scandal broke last year, Bentley apologized for making inappropriate remarks to married staffer Rebekah Mason, while denying allegations of a physical affair. Mason resigned as questions about the pair\\'s relationship began to dominate Alabama politics. Bentley\\'s wife filed for divorce in August 2015 after 50 years of marriage, citing unspecified problems. Local media said the ethics commission found probable cause that Bentley violated state campaign regulations by accepting a contribution and making a loan to his campaign outside the time frame permitted by law and using campaign funds to pay Mason\\'s legal fees. He also may have violated ethics law by using public resources for his personal interest. If charged with breaking Alabama\\'s ethics or campaign finance laws, Bentley could 20 years in prison per violation, the commission said.',\n",

A group of three Muslim men attacked strangers at the Liverpool city center because they were white non-Muslims. One witness feared the men were ISIS terrorists because they were using racist language, talking about Muslims and Christians. A very similar occurrence took place in one of Minneapolis more upscale neighborhoods last year when a mob of up to 30 young Somali men marched through the streets yelling disparaging comments and threatening homeowners:Somalis living in Minneapolis are almost all Sunni Muslims. Residents of the Lake Calhoun area say this wasn t the first time a group of Somali men have made an intimidating march through their neighborhood, which is filled with million-dollar homes.They first approached victim Gary Bohanna inquiring what religion he was affiliated with. When Bohanna answered I m a Christian, the attacker shouted Why aren t you a Muslim? before punching him twice. The three men then approached Paul Lynch, Labour councillor for Moss Bank, and his girlfriend. One of the men punched Mr. Lynch with a sickening blow that could be seen and heard. He did not utter any racist comments, but the attackers laughed as the victim fell. Both men were taken to the hospital for their injuries.Witness Edris Nosrati called police but one of the men tried to flee, so the witness chased and caught him. The teenager struck Mr. Nosrati, but the hero held on. When questioned by police, one of the men claimed he was too intoxicated to remember anything. Another denied the assaults and suggested they had been racially abused by other men. However, he later confessed to targeting people because they were white and non-Muslim.

He mentioned that because he believe in the gospels that every person has equal worth, that makes him pro-life.Pirro asked Huckabee if the outrage over the president s remarks are just Trump haters who will look for any reason to dump on him. Well it seems like a lot of them are, I don t know what they expect the president to do, Huckabee responded. At the time that he made the comment, the driver of the car had not even been identified. That s exactly right! Pirro exclaimed. And so what is he supposed to say? Huckabee continued. Is he supposed to do what Barack Obama used to do and jump to conclusion and make a decision like he did in Ferguson. Missouri, which turned out to be totally untrue? The president has to be careful in taking steps. I thought what he condemned was what we all could immediately condemn and that was the violence, the car some coward in a car drove into innocent people to try and kill them. And he condemned that!

              " 'President Trump loves to set the day\\'s narrative at dawn, but the deeper story of his White House is best told at night. Aides confer in the dark because they cannot figure out how to operate the light switches in the cabinet room. Visitors conclude their meetings and then wander around, testing doorknobs until finding one that leads to an exit. In a darkened, mostly empty West Wing, Mr. Trump\\'s provocative chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, finishes another day planning new lines of attack. Usually around 6:30 p. m. or sometimes later, Mr. Trump retires upstairs to the residence to recharge, vent and intermittently use Twitter. With his wife, Melania, and young son, Barron, staying in New York, he is almost always by himself, sometimes in the protective presence of his imposing longtime aide and former security chief, Keith Schiller. When Mr. Trump is not watching television in his bathrobe or on his phone reaching out to old campaign hands and advisers, he will sometimes set off to explore the unfamiliar surroundings of his new home. During his first two dizzying weeks in office, Mr. Trump, an outsider president working with a surprisingly small crew of no more than a empowered aides with virtually no familiarity with the workings of the White House or federal government, sent shock waves at home and overseas with a succession of executive orders designed to fulfill campaign promises and taunt foreign leaders. \"We are moving big and we are moving fast,\" Mr. Bannon said, when asked about the upheaval of the first two weeks. \"We didn\\'t come here to do small things. \" But one thing has become apparent to both his allies and his opponents: When it comes to governing, speed does not always guarantee success. The bungled rollout of his executive order barring immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries, a flurry of other miscues and embarrassments, and an approval rating lower than that of any comparable president in the history of polling have Mr. Trump and his top staff rethinking an improvisational approach to governing that mirrors his chaotic presidential campaign, administration officials and Trump insiders said. This account of the early days of the Trump White House is based on interviews with dozens of government officials, congressional aides, former staff members and other observers of the new administration, many of whom requested anonymity. At the center of the story, according to these sources, is a president determined to go big but increasingly frustrated by the efforts of his small team to contain the backlash. \"What are we going to do about this?\" Mr. Trump pointedly asked an aide last week, a period of turmoil briefly interrupted by the successful rollout of his Supreme Court selection, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch. Chris Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and an old friend of the president\\'s, said: \"I think, in his mind, the success of this is going to be the poll numbers. If they continue to be weak or go lower, then somebody\\'s going to have to bear some responsibility for that. \" \"I personally think that they\\'re missing the big picture here,\" Mr. Ruddy said of Mr. Trump\\'s staff. \"Now he\\'s so caught up, the administration is so caught up in turmoil, perceived chaos, that the Democrats smell blood, the protesters, the media smell blood. \" One former staff member likened the aggressive approach of the first two weeks to but said the president\\'s team had stormed the beaches without any plan for a longer war. Clashes among staff are common in the opening days of every administration, but they have seldom been so public and so pronounced this early. \"This is a president who came to Washington vowing to shake up the establishment, and this is what it looks like. It\\'s going to be a little sloppy, there are going to be conflicts,\" said Ari Fleischer, President George W. Bush\\'s first press secretary. All this is happening as Mr. Trump, a man of flexible ideology but fixed habits, adjusts to a new job, life and city. Cloistered in the White House, he now has little access to his fans and supporters â€” an important source of feedback and validation â€” and feels increasingly pinched by the pressures of the job and the constant presence of protests, one of the reasons he was forced to scrap a planned trip to Milwaukee last week. For a sense of what is happening outside, he watches cable, both at night and during the day â€” too much in the eyes of some aides â€” often offering a bitter of critics like CNN\\'s Don Lemon. Until the past few days, Mr. Trump was telling his friends and advisers that he believed the opening stages of his presidency were going well. \"Did you hear that, this guy thinks it\\'s been terrible!\" Mr. Trump said mockingly to other aides when one dissenting view was voiced last week during a West Wing meeting. But his opinion has begun to change with a relentless parade of bad headlines. Mr. Trump got away from the White House this weekend for the first time since his inauguration, spending it in Palm Beach, Fla. at his private club, posting Twitter messages angrily â€” and in personal terms â€” about the federal judge who put a nationwide halt on the travel ban. Mr. Bannon and Reince Priebus, the two clashing power centers, traveled with him. By then, the president, for whom chains of command and policy minutiae rarely meant much, was demanding that Mr. Priebus begin to put in effect a much more conventional White House protocol that had been taken for granted in previous administrations: From now on, Mr. Trump would be looped in on the drafting of executive orders much earlier in the process. Another change will be a new set of checks on the previously unfettered power enjoyed by Mr. Bannon and the White House policy director, Stephen Miller, who oversees the implementation of the orders and who received the brunt of the internal and public criticism for the rollout of the travel ban. Mr. Priebus has told Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon that the administration needs to rethink its policy and communications operation in the wake of embarrassing revelations that key details of the orders were withheld from agencies, White House staff and Republican congressional leaders like Speaker Paul D. Ryan. Mr. Priebus has also created a checklist for the release of any new initiatives that includes signoff from the communications department and the White House staff secretary, Robert Porter, according to several aides familiar with the process. Mr. Priebus bristles at the perception that he occupies a diminished perch in the West Wing pecking order compared with previous chiefs. But for the moment, Mr. Bannon remains the president\\'s dominant adviser, despite Mr. Trump\\'s anger that he was not fully briefed on details of the executive order he signed giving his chief strategist a seat on the National Security Council, a greater source of frustration to the president than the fallout from the travel ban. It is partly because he is seen as having a clear vision on policy. But it is also because others who had been expected to fill major roles have been less confident in asserting their power. Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\\'s occupies a central role in the administration and has been present at most major decisions and photo ops, but he is a father of young children who has taken to life in Washington, and, along with his wife, Ivanka Trump, has already been spotted at events around town. Mr. Bannon has rushed into the vacuum, telling allies that he and Mr. Miller have a brief window in which to push through their vision of Mr. Trump\\'s economic nationalism. Mr. Bannon, whose website, Breitbart, was a magnet for white nationalists and xenophobic speech, has also tried to reassure official Washington. He has been careful to build bridges with the Republican establishment, especially Mr. Ryan â€” whom he once described as \"the enemy\" and vowed to force out. He now talks regularly with Mr. Ryan to coordinate strategy or plot their planned overhaul of the tax code. Before he was ousted in November as transition chief, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, the Trump adviser with the most government experience, helped prepare a detailed staffing and implementation plan in line with the kickoff strategies of previous Republican presidents. It was discarded â€” a senior Trump aide made a show of tossing it into a garbage can â€” for a strategy that prioritized the daily release of dramatic executive orders to put opponents on the defensive. Mr. Christie, who agrees in principle with the broad strokes of Mr. Trump\\'s immigration policy, says the president has been let down by his staff. \"The president deserves better than the rollout he got on the immigration executive order,\" Mr. Christie said. \"The fact is that he\\'s put forward a policy that, in my opinion, is significantly more effective than what he had proposed during the campaign, yet because of the botched implementation, they allowed his opponents to attack him by calling it a Muslim ban. \" In the past few days, Mr. Trump\\'s team has stressed its cohesion and the challenges of an administration that few outside its group ever thought would exist. \"This team spent months in the foxhole together during the campaign,\" said Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. \"We moved into the White House as a unified team committed to enacting the president\\'s agenda. \" As part of Mr. Trump\\'s Oval Office renovation, he ordered that four hardback chairs be placed in a semicircle around his Resolute Desk now heaped, in Trump Tower fashion, with memos and newspapers. They are an emblem of Mr. Trump\\'s management style, but also a reminder that in the White House, the seats always outlast the people seated in them. But finding enough skilled players to fill key slots has not been easy: Mr. Spicer is serving double duty as communications director, a key planning position, in addition to engaging in combat with the news media. Mr. Trump, several aides said, is used to quarterbacking his own media strategy, and did not see the value of hiring an outsider. An early plan was to give the communications job to Kellyanne Conway, his former campaign manager and top TV surrogate, but the demands of the job would have conflicted with Ms. Conway\\'s other duties as a adviser to Mr. Trump with Oval Office privileges, according to one aide. Mr. Trump remains intensely focused on his brand, but the demands of the job mean he spends less time monitoring the news media â€” although he recently upgraded the TV in his private dining room so he can watch the news while eating lunch. He often has to wait until the end of the workday before grinding through news clips with Mr. Spicer, marking the ones he does not like with a big arrow in black Sharpie â€” though he almost always makes time to monitor Mr. Spicer\\'s performance at the daily briefings, summoning him to offer praise or criticism, a West Wing aide said. Visitors to the Oval Office say Mr. Trump is obsessed with the dÃ©cor â€” it is both a totem of a victory that validates him as a serious person and an backdrop â€” so he has told his staff to schedule as many televised events in the room as possible. To pass the time between meetings, Mr. Trump gives quick tours to visitors, highlighting little tweaks he has made after initially expecting he would have to pay for them himself. Flanking his desk are portraits of Presidents Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson. He will linger on the opulence of the newly hung golden drapes, which he told a recent visitor were once used by Franklin D. Roosevelt but in fact were patterned for Bill Clinton. For a man who sometimes has trouble concentrating on policy memos, Mr. Trump was delighted to page through a book that offered him 17 window covering options. Ultimately, this is very much the White House that Mr. Trump wanted to build. But while the world reckons with the effect he is having on the presidency, he is adjusting to the effect of the presidency on him. He is now a public employee. And the only boss Mr. Trump ever had in his life was his father, a developer the president still treats with deep reverence. With most of his belongings in New York, the only family picture on the shelf behind Mr. Trump\\'s desk is a small photograph of that boss, Frederick Christ Trump.',\n",

              " 'Donald Trump\\'s looming nomination has spurred some leaders of the conservative movement â€” for generations, the backbone of the GOP â€” to break free from a Republican Party now being rapidly reshaped by the New York billionaire\\'s incendiary tone and unorthodox populism. The extraordinary resistance of many figures on the right this past week to Trump has not been prompted merely by objections to his temperament and fears about his electability in November. At the core has been a calculation by self-identified \"movement conservatives\" that they would rather preserve their entrenched ideological project than promote a nominee who they believe would violate their creed and ethos. [Video: The 10 Republicans who hate Donald Trump the most ] \"It\\'s a crisis,\" said Al Cardenas, a former chairman of the American Conservative Union who is withholding support for Trump. \"If we do away with the fundamental strength of the conservative movement, which is our ideas and values and principles, then you don\\'t have anything left but politics. A movement can survive the loss of an election cycle, but it can\\'t survive the loss of its purpose, and that\\'s what we\\'re battling here.\" The moment potentially marks the closure of a historic half-century in Republican politics in which conservatives have accrued dominant influence â€” on Capitol Hill, in gubernatorial mansions, at think tanks, on talk radio and in the grass roots. Since Barry Goldwater\\'s unsuccessful but edifying 1964 presidential run, the conservative movement has been at the crux of Republican campaigns, from Ronald Reagan\\'s 1980 sweep to the 1994 revolution to the tea party\\'s rise in 2010. Yet, by taking a stand they see as a stroke of moral clarity, conservative leaders are at risk of separating their coalition from a Republican Party in which voters coast to coast have effectively shifted the center of gravity by choosing Trump as their standard bearer. In the primaries, Trump defeated a string of classically conservative candidates by peeling away many of the movement\\'s core supporters: evangelical and working-class white voters. There is talk in various quarters about a potential independent challenge to Trump and likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, though there is no consensus candidate, and a third-party bid would be exceedingly difficult for anyone to mount at this late stage. Freshman Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) is a vocal proponent, but he is not offering himself as a candidate. Bill Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard, is involved in discussions to draft an independent conservative and huddled last week with Mitt Romney, though the former Massachusetts governor repeatedly has ruled out another White House bid. Erick Erickson, a prominent conservative commentator, is among those urging a third-party candidate. \"One of the silver linings that can come from this is that the conservative movement as an entity pulls back away from the Republican Party,\" Erickson said. \"During the Bush administration, it became a subsidiary of the Republican Party. This gives us a good opportunity as conservatives to stand on our own two feet.\" The conservative resistance was expressed most prominently last week by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, the country\\'s top-ranking elected Republican, who announced that he could not support Trump until the business mogul demonstrated his conservative bona fides and offered a more inclusive vision. Trump snapped back with a retort that neatly underscored his belief that movement conservatives should no longer dictate the GOP mission and platform: \"I am not ready to support Speaker Ryan\\'s agenda.\" \"If there\\'s an ideological leader of our party right now, it\\'s Paul Ryan,\" said former senator Judd Gregg (R-N.H.). \"He\\'s not part of the shouting crowd; he\\'s part of the doing crowd. But the party\\'s voters have gone with the shouting crowd. It\\'s reflective of the failure of the doer crowd to get things done.\" [Ryan says he is \\'not ready\\' to back Trump, deepening GOP divide] Indeed, Trump and Ryan are miles apart. Ryan is the architect of sweeping proposed changes to Medicare and Social Security; Trump has pledged not to touch either. Ryan supports a muscular foreign policy; Trump is proudly non-interventionist. Ryan champions free trade; Trump is an avowed opponent. Ryan defends religious freedom; Trump wants to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country. Ryan advocates bipartisan immigration reform and opposes mass deportation; Trump wants to build a wall at the Mexican border and deport the roughly 11 million immigrants who are living in the United States illegally. Ryan and his conservative allies in elected offices nationwide still have a firm grip on the party\\'s governing playbook and institutions. But Trump has forced a heated debate over Republican identity and whether it is synonymous with conservatism â€” a threat to the authority of movement conservatives. \"The Ryan agenda isn\\'t just about Paul Ryan, but it\\'s what conservatives have agreed on as the best way forward â€” and Trump is deviating from that in so many ways,\" said Lanhee Chen, a fellow at Stanford University\\'s Hoover Institution who served as Romney\\'s policy director during his 2012 presidential bid. \"The big question really is, to what extent is the Trump phenomenon an aberration in policy versus some more fundamental shift?\" Chen asked. \"I tend to think of it as an aberration.\" Republican National Chairman Reince Priebus has sought to broker an accord between Trump and Ryan with a planned meeting Thursday in Washington, but Trump\\'s public comments suggest that changes by him are unlikely. Trump has said he would meet with Ryan, \"before we go our separate ways.\" [Trump agrees to meet with Paul Ryan \\'before we go our separate ways\\'] Some conservative movement figures have warmed to Trump, expressing confidence that he would surround himself with advisers of their ilk â€” such as Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who has become a trusted confidant of the candidate\\'s â€” and that, if Trump is elected, Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) would serve as checks on his power. \"The deals he\\'s going to cut will have in the room Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, and the three of them have to agree. I sleep well at night,\" said Grover Norquist, president and founder of Americans for Tax Reform, who for decades has convened conservative leaders and activists. A group of House Republicans, including several top leadership supporters, have wondered whether Ryan and other conservative leaders have fully recognized what they see as a striking shift in the electorate. A pair of committee chairmen â€” Reps. Bill Shuster (Pa.) and Jeff Miller (Fla.) â€” endorsed Trump shortly before he became the presumptive nominee. \"It\\'s not the time to be out there demanding all of these things, trying to get Trump to suddenly become Reagan,\" said William J. Bennett, a Ryan mentor and prominent conservative commentator. \"Now is the time to surround him with good people and work with him at the convention.\" Norquist, who attended and praised Trump\\'s foreign-policy address last month, said he sees limits to Trump\\'s long-term influence on conservatism. \"You\\'re not picking a direction for the modern Republican Party or the conservative movement with one presidential candidate,\" he said. \"There isn\\'t some Trump wing of the party. What is Trumpism? You don\\'t see senators and governors running under Trumpism. There\\'s just Trump.\" [Trump\\'s apostasies put him at odds with decades of Republican beliefs] Especially anxious about Trump\\'s success are conservatives who prioritize social issues and fear he would weaken the party\\'s moral tilt. Though Trump says he is against abortion and same-sex marriage, the New Yorker rarely talks about those issues â€” and until only a few years ago, he held opposite positions. \"I haven\\'t heard him frame things in moral terms,\" Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) said. \"I don\\'t hear him speak about the Constitution. It\\'s hard to believe he has any sort of deep conviction on life and marriage. I don\\'t see him being guided by constitutional principles. He doesn\\'t speak about them, ever. That\\'s what\\'s troubling everyone. He\\'s not even speaking in the same language, politically, that we speak.\" King, who had supported Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and has no plans to endorse Trump, said he and other conservative leaders would \"keep watch\" at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland to protect the party\\'s platform from being revamped. \"We run the risk of the underpinnings of our convictions being disregarded,\" King said. Numerous Republicans fret that this divide could lead to certain electoral defeat for the party, up and down the ticket. Those like Gregg â€” a fiscal conservative who backed former Florida governor Jeb Bush and then Ohio Gov. John Kasich in the primaries and said he is in the \"listening\" phase of considering Trump â€” see hope for a coming together by finding areas of consensus. \"At the center of Republican philosophy is market economy and fiscal responsibility, and Trump is very much in tune,\" Gregg said. \"I expect in the end that\\'s what will draw people into a unified effort.\"',\n",

              " 'An Egyptian lawyer who is helping investigate the case of murdered Italian student Giulio Regeni was prevented from flying to a U.N. conference and detained by a special prosecutor, his supporters and a security source said. Ibrahim Metwaly, who founded the Association of the Families of the Disappeared after his son disappeared in suspicious circumstances four years ago, himself went missing while heading for his flight to Geneva on Sunday. Members of his group said he was taken from Cairo airport by airport security and he was not heard from until Wednesday when a state security prosecutor ordered him detained for 15 days on charges of joining a group founded illegally , judicial sources said. There was no comment from the Interior Ministry. A security source said Metwaly was legally arrested and not subjected to any violations. Rights activists say Egyptian security forces resort to kidnapping government opponents and keeping them in secret jails where they can spend weeks, months, or years without charge. The authorities deny the accusation. Italian graduate student Giulio Regeni, who was conducting research on Egyptian trade unions, disappeared in Cairo on Jan. 25 last year. His body was discovered in a ditch on the outskirts of the Egyptian capital on Feb. 3, showing signs of extensive torture. Metwaly has been assisting lawyers working on the Regeni case as an expert on enforced disappearances, according to one of the lawyers. I have no doubts Ibrahim s arrest was in connection to the Regeni case and his upcoming trip, a source at the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF), a Cairo-based NGO, told Reuters. ECRF lawyers are providing legal representation for the Regeni family in Egypt. Metwaly s son Abdelmoniem Metwaly said his father was now in a Cairo jail and that he was also charged with conducting espionage on behalf of a foreign entity , something he said referred to the U.N. Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances which he was due to address in Geneva. There was no immediate comment from the U.N. body. Regeni s murder has strained ties between Italy and Egypt, traditional Mediterranean allies with strong economic ties. Security and intelligence sources said Regeni was arrested the day he vanished and taken into custody. Egyptian officials have denied any involvement in his death. Italy recalled its ambassador in April 2016 as it sought to obtain evidence from Egypt to solve the murder. Magistrates in Rome and Cairo have met half a dozen times over the past year but no one has been charged. A new Italian ambassador arrived in Cairo on Wednesday. Pier Antonio Panzeri, an Italian lawmaker who chairs the European Parliament s Subcommittee on Human Rights, said in a statement: I am disturbed by alleged reports that lawyer Ibrahim Metwaly was arrested ... while he was about to fly to Geneva to address the U.N.

She said it was not published in the school paper because it was too controversial for them, but here it is for our readers... *Commander Jeff Schoep* Think of an American champion. Someone who fights for the greater good, a noble cause, and selflessly dedicates their life to better yours. You might think of John Adams, Ronald Reagan, Martin Luther King Jr., or even a military hero such as George Patton. All of these men were not afraid to challenge controversial ideas and would never admit defeat. They were rightly put into history books, and became legends. What we admire about them is their will to fight, and its what makes them heroes. I found a living champion in the city of Detroit, Michigan. His name is Commander Jeff Schoep, an extremely controversial political figure in charge of the largest neo-Nazi group in the United States. The National Socialist Movement is an organization dedicated to the preservation of their \"proud European heritage\" and the creation of a National Socialist Society in America and around the world. As Commander, Schoep over sees the NSM organization, NSM88 Record Label and Radio, New Saxon website, and most recently SS Enterprise. By now, its obvious why Commander Jeff Schoep holds a position which many would find contentious. NSM has grown considerably since the Schoep took office in 1994, an vital action for the organization whose numbers were dwindling. Since Schoep stepped into the shoes of former Commander Cliff Herrington, he has taken a staggering amount of poor publicity. The endless supposed \"inside\" editorials \"exposing\" NSM, and with it their Commander seem to be constantly bombarding mainstream America. But numbers don\\'t lie! Under Commander Jeff Schoep NSM has gained in strength, numbers, and their business prospects continue to grow and flourish. It seems NSM is not only resilient but the negative publicity has encouraged people to join their cause, and convince current members to steadily hold fast to their beliefs. This is a direct reflection of the action, leadership and dedication of the Commander. As a leader he not only makes it his career, but his life\\'s purpose to spread his message of unity through a \"greater America\". He religiously signs off as, \"If you\\'re not part of the Solution, you\\'re part of the Problem.\" While he is advocating for his cause, gaining membership and bringing groups of people together under one ideal, obscure \"journalists\" looking for something or someone to slur, attempt to further tear a fragile America apart. Now you tell me who the bad guy is. Maybe you don\\'t agree with his principles, but you have to admit the Commander is persistent in the face of a hostile contradiction. Why hasn\\'t the Commander gotten any positive, or even neutral credit for the work he has done? Do we, as a society only give recognition to those people whose causes we deem \"appropriate\" or \"popular\"? Its more than obvious what the answer is. And its unfortunate because I believe that Commander Jeff Schoep has surely pushed NSM forward against almost impossible odds.

              " 'Two women accused of murdering the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un with a banned nerve agent pleaded not guilty at the start of a high-profile murder trial in a Malaysian court on Monday. Indonesian Siti Aisyah, 25, and Doan Thi Huong, 28, a Vietnamese, are charged with killing Kim Jong Nam by smearing his face with VX, a chemical poison banned by the United Nations, at Kuala Lumpur airport on Feb. 13. Both women wore bullet-proof vests as they were led into the court on the outskirts of the Malaysian capital. They face the death penalty if convicted. Police have also named four North Koreans as suspects in the case and an Interpol red notice, an international alert just short of an arrest warrant, has been issued for the North Koreans, who remain at large. Defence lawyers demanded that the prosecution immediately name the four other suspects, who have also been charged, so they can prepare their case. The charge must be clear, said Siti Aisyah s lawyer, Gooi Soon Seng. Judge Azmi Ariffin dismissed their request. The two women nodded their heads when the charges were read out by two interpreters. They pleaded not guilty. The prosecution said the women s actions showed intent to kill the victim by smearing his face and eyes with VX nerve agent, which a Malaysian post-mortem confirmed had killed Kim. The women told their lawyers they did not know they were participating in a deadly attack and believed they were carrying out a prank for a reality TV show. The prank practice carried out by the first and second accused with the supervision of the four who are still at large was preparation to see through their common intention to kill the victim, lead prosecutor Muhamad Iskandar Ahmad said in his opening statement. The two women sat quietly in the packed courtroom. Siti was dressed in a black floral suit, while Huong wore a white long-sleeved t-shirt and jeans. Juliana Idris, who works at the airport, told the court a man later identified as Kim Jong Nam approached her and asked her to take him to a police station. She said the man, who spoke English, told her he had been attacked by a woman from behind ... another one closed his eyes . His hands were shaking a bit, I don t know why, she said. Police Lance Corporal Mohd Zulkarnain Sanudin, who was on duty at the airport, said Juliana had brought Kim Jong Nam to him. He said Kim told him a substance had been wiped on his face. Kim s eyes were red and he could see some liquid on his face, Zulkarnain said. He also said the he had wrongly recorded Kim Jong Nam s nationality as South Korean. The police report I made showed the nationality as South Korean, while on the passport, it was written DPR Korea, whereby I did not know what DPR meant. I was only sure that Korea was South Korea, he told the court. DPRK are the initials for North Korea s official name, the Democratic Republic of North Korea. Other witnesses described how Kim Jong Nam had seizures at the clinic - his eyes rolled upwards and there was drooling of saliva and mucus. Rabiatul Adawiyah Mohd Sofi, a medical assistant, said Kim Jong Nam was at the clinic for just over an hour and moved to a hospital. By the time they arrived at the hospital emergency ward, they could not get a blood pressure reading, she said. There was a high probability that there was either a problem with our monitor or the patient had died, said Rabiatul. The case continues on Tuesday.',\n",

G4S said Ben Saunders, director of the immigration removal center near Gatwick Airport in southeast England, would be replaced on an interim basis by Lee Hanford from Monday, Sept. 25, pending the appointment of a permanent successor. British lawmakers accused G4S last week of repeated failures of detainee welfare safeguards and whistleblowing mechanisms at the immigration center, after physical and verbal abuse by guards was revealed in a BBC documentary. G4S, contracted by the British government to run the Brook House center, earlier this month suspended 10 members of staff, three of whom have now been sacked, for abusive behavior following the documentary. Police are also investigating. Earlier this year an investigation at the G4S-run Medway Secure Training Centre resulted in allegations of abuse and mistreatment of youngsters.

              " \"What a wreak - literally. We have a shipwreck, a love affair on the rocks, people trying to run other's lives when they can't run their own. Ross in deep in debt with Warleggan liking nothing more than to crush him. Julia is born and the apple of her parents eye. Verity Poldark & Andrew Blamey want forever and Francis say no. Mark & Karen Daniels and Dr. Enys - oh my! Affairs, Bitterness, christening, deceit, envy, folly, gambling, hunger, illness, jealousy, kindness, lies, murder, oppression, parties, quarrels, revelry, snobs, violence. And in the end a beautiful moment of hope. Totally addicted to this series back in the 70's watching it on Masterpiece Theatre Sunday nights with my mom and sisters. I eagerly gobbled up the first 4 books 1945 - Ross Poldark 1946 - Demelza 1950 - Jeremy Poldark 1953 - Warleggan I stopped reading the series in 1977 as the novels had gotten so dark that I wasn't enjoying where the author was taking the characters. 1973 - The Black Moon 1976 - The Four Swans 1977 - The Angry Tide I was poking in a book store on vacation and picked up 'The Twisted Sword' and enjoyed it tremendously (with one exception - I didn't care for the outcome for Jeremy at all). It was so good seeing Zacky Martin & Mrs. Zacky, Tholly Tregolis, Jud & Trudy Paynter - they hadn't changed at all. Dwight & Caroline Enys (and Horace), Verity & Andrew Blamey. And of course Demelza and Ross (still all too human). George Warleggan remains the same fascinating character. And Cornwall, Nampara (the Ross Poldark home) Wheal Grace and Wheal Leisure all so familiar 40 years later. 1981 - The Stranger from the Sea 1982 - The Miller's Dance 1984 - The Loving Cup 1990 - The Twisted Sword 2002 - Bella Poldark I am not sure I will pick up the last book as from the the reviews I don't think I will enjoy it as much. The author passed away in 2003 at age 90 soit is truly the last written by him. From the publisher: Demelza, the miner's daughter that Poldark rescued from a fairground rabble, is now his wife. Demelza's efforts to adapt to the ways of the gentry bring her confusion and heartache, despite the joy in the birth of their first child. Additionally the seeds of dispute with Warleggan are sown. Also from the Publisher: the Poldark series, the subject of the landmark BBC series Ross Poldark is a heartwarming, gripping, and utterly entertaining saga that brings to life an unforgettable cast of characters and one of the greatest love stories of our age. An intricately plotted story spanning loves, lives, and generations. The Poldark series is the masterwork of Winston Graham, who evoked the period and people like only he could, and created a world of rich and poor, loss and love, that readers will not soon forget.\",\n",

Now, it seems a massive unknown force disturbed NASA's satellite H1 on November 17, 2016 which almost led to an equipment malfunction. On November 16, the satellite was still functioning normally then on the 17th something disturbed the satellite but the H1 camera still managed to capture images and one day later the 18th everything returned to normal. Images captured on the 17th show a giant spherical object which was probably the cause of the incident. Whether the object is one of the giant extraterrestrial or interdimensional spacecraft, which are accessing our solar system, using the Sun as a stargate or an unknown celestial body like the famed planet Nibiru, it is clear what happened on the 17th was not the result of an equipment failure. Note: Planet Nibiru â€“ This mysterious object has been researched by Intellihub's Shepard Ambellas for over 25 years and is likely the basis for all emergency preparations by world governments which we've seen transpire over the last three decades after the object was discovered during the Regan Administration by NASA's IRAS telescope.

We will let you know as soon as a program is available. In the meantime, members are encouraged to get cash one of these ways to avoid fees: - Use your VISA Check Card to get cash back at merchants. These are fee-free transactions. - Use our ATM in the lobby of the Enron Building or 3 Allen Center, or try the approximate 100 fee-free ATMs in the Houston area that display the Select ATM logo (visit enronfcu.com for locations). - Visit one of our Service Center branches (visit enronfcu.com for locations). - We will also waive our fee on 3 unaffiliated ATM transactions per month. Phone Accessibility - In January 2001, we established a phone center to answer incoming calls to our main number. An automated system initially prompts you, but the option to speak to a live operator is available. Your call may be forwarded to an EFCU representative, and you may get voice mail. In this instance, we will return your call as soon as possible.

We added several tellers this year to help the traffic flow in the teller area and are now filled to capacity at all stations. As you know, the teller lines are sometimes heavy on paydays. To help minimize your wait time, here are a few other options to handle your transactions: - Make deposits & withdrawals at our ATMs in the Enron Building Lobby or 3 Allen Center. Deposits are retrieved between 2:30 and 3:00 p.m. and are posted the same day. - Make deposits at our Night Drop Box on the 3rd floor of the Enron Building, outside of the EFCU front doors.

              " 'American intelligence agencies believe that the Russian government was behind the theft of emails and documents from the Democratic National Committee, but many questions remain about how the documents made their way to WikiLeaks, which released them. Before the WikiLeaks release, a large sampling was published by several news organizations and a hacker called Guccifer 2. 0, who investigators now believe was an agent of the G. R. U. Russia\\'s military intelligence service. American intelligence agencies say the earlier leaks from Guccifer and the WikiLeaks material have the same bits of code and telltale metadata traced to previous intrusions attributed to the G. R. U. or the F. S. B. another Russian spy agency. However, Julian Assange, the editor of WikiLeaks, makes a distinction between the Democratic National Committee material he released and the earlier releases by Guccifer and others, saying there is no proof that the Russians gave him the documents. In recent weeks, Mr. Assange has threatened to take his revelations to a new level. In August, some of the National Security Agency\\'s source code for breaking into foreign computer systems â€” the holy grail of the N. S. A. \\'s Tailored Access Operations unit â€” was revealed on a website, with the announcement of an auction for the remainder of it. Mr. Assange then declared he would soon publish the rest on WikiLeaks free. So far he has not. Most experts say the code â€” the digital equivalent of codes for the release of weapons â€” could have come only from one of two sources: another N. S. A. insider like Edward J. Snowden or, more likely, an external computer server that the N. S. A. \\'s artists used in the course of an operation. If they had left their digital tool kit on that server, and the Russians or another power was already inside that network, the code would have been stolen. The N. S. A. has not said whether the code released was real or where it came from. This week, suspicions of Russian tampering took a new turn with reports that earlier this summer, the F. B. I. warned election officials in Arizona about Russian hackers targeting systems there. The Senate minority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, asked the F. B. I. to investigate, writing to the director, James B. Comey, that the threat of Russian interference \"is more extensive than is widely known and may include the intent to falsify official election results. \" The administration has stopped short of publicly accusing the Russian government of engineering the theft of the Democratic National Committee emails, presumably to buy time for President Obama to make a decision. James R. Clapper Jr. the director of national intelligence, said last month that American spy agencies were not yet prepared to publicly identify a culprit.',\n",

              " 'The November U.S. presidential election is being sold by the major parties as a defining moment for the next generation of Americans. But stock and options traders, often moved to action by political headlines, are responding with a big \\'meh.\\' Options bets on volatility around the Nov. 8 election are running lower than could be expected given how stocks have performed in past election cycles, BNP Paribas said. Typically, stock market volatility picks up around presidential elections. Traders use options to guard against outsized market reaction to such events. The CBOE Volatility Index, the most widely followed gauge of near-term investor anxiety, had some big spikes this year, hitting a four-month high after the Brexit vote. But there is little to suggest that November is a big worry for stocks. Investors are focused on the quarterly earnings season starting next week. They might also be taking the view that both the Republican and Democratic prospective nominees would be more favorable for business than the current administration, analysts said. \"It\\'s like the opposite of \\'Alien vs. Predator,\\'\" said Mark Sebastian, chief investment officer at volatility arbitrage hedge fund Karman Line Capital in Chicago, referring to the 2004 American science fiction film which had the tagline \\'whoever wins, we lose.\\' \"Here, no matter who wins, Wall Street does better,\" he said. Despite being called anti-business by some on Wall Street, the Obama administration has been in power over one of the best presidential cycles for stocks on record. Per BNP Paribas data, S&P 500 Index options forward implied volatility, which measures volatility expectations embedded in options, shows no dislocation over the remaining election campaign period. Had there been a big bump-up in this measure for November it would have been a sign that traders were loading up on protective contracts. \"The market is not ascribing a large probability to a high volatility scenario over the election period,\" said Stewart Warther, an equity derivatives strategist at BNP Paribas. Market-makers, or dealers which quote prices for options, are also not expressing a great deal of anxiety over stock gyrations. If stock volatility does not pick up in November, that would be a departure from the norm, according a BNP Paribas analysis of data going back to 1948. \"The shape of the (volatility) curve definitely is upward sloping but it\\'s not like there is a huge hump out in November,\" said Steve Sosnick, an equity risk manager at Timber Hill, the market-making unit of Interactive Brokers Group Inc. \"We have seen some demand for options but I would say it\\'s hardly a frenzy.\"',\n",

              " 'MELBOURNE, Australia â€” \"So Ivan, are you calling Andy \\'Sir\\'?\" Ivan Lendl paused and then laughed, which would surely seem strange to those who know him only as Andy Murray\\'s coach in the front row of the players\\' box. \"Definitely not,\" Lendl said, chuckling some more before heading off down the crowded main hallway inside Rod Laver Arena at the Australian Open. Clearly, not much has changed in the Murray camp since his remarkable stretch run to the No. 1 ranking and a knighthood in 2016. He is still tough on himself on court and on the changeovers. Still Andy â€” not Sir Andy â€” to his peers and mentor in chief, Lendl. Still deadpan and droll with his voice that sounds as if it emanates from a mine shaft. Asked on Monday by the interviewer John Fitzgerald how Murray\\'s wife, Kim, was handling the transition to Lady Kim, Murray said, \"No more swearing during my matches, for anyone who saw that a few years ago. \" He was referring to Kim\\'s courtside language during his semifinal victory over Tomas Berdych at the 2015 Australian Open. Her tirade did not go unnoticed, and she returned for the final cheekily wearing a shirt that read, \"Parental advisory explicit content. \" Presumably, Lady Kim won\\'t be wearing that sort of thing in the players\\' box from here on, either (or at least she wasn\\'t on Monday). \"I haven\\'t found it distracting really,\" Murray said of the knighthood. \"I mean, I found out about it four or five weeks ago. Maybe if it happened a day or so, two days before the tournament. But I\\'ve had enough time to get my head around it. \" Just as he has had plenty of time to prepare himself for the role of No. 1, however long it lasts. I asked him on Monday, after his stuttering (5) victory over Illya Marchenko, if there had been any downside to No. 1, thinking he might bring up extra demands or burdens. \"No,\" he said. \"It\\'s been great. I think because it\\'s taken me so long to get there, obviously I want to try to stay there. But also I feel like I\\'m mature enough now to handle it. Maybe if it happens when you\\'re very young, you might feel extra pressures. The responsibilities might feel a bit much, but I think because I\\'m much older and more mature, it\\'s been good. \" The conventional tennis wisdom is that it is harder to hang on at the top than to reach the top. \"I hope not,\" Murray said. But for anyone who believes that he now has nowhere to go but down, that is hardly true in Australia. He has reached five singles finals in Melbourne and lost all five. No man has done so well at any Grand Slam tournament without breaking through to win the title. Others have lost five finals in the same major event, including Lendl, who lost five at the United States Open. But he also won three. Bill Johnston lost six finals at the United States Championships, but won the event twice. John Bromwich lost five finals at the Australian Championships in the era, but won the title twice, too. Murray, at 29, is in unfortunately uncharted territory, all the more so because Novak Djokovic ended his own long run of frustration at the French Open last year by finally taking the title after reaching four semifinals and three finals. \"Look, it\\'s still a remarkable record, five Slam finals in Australia, and deep down I think it means an enormous amount to Andy to finally complete the puzzle,\" said Roger Rasheed, the Australian who once coached Lleyton Hewitt when Hewitt was chasing the title here without success. But Hewitt reached only one final in Melbourne. Murray is here and has a better winning percentage at the Australian Open than at any other Grand Slam tournament except Wimbledon. \"Andy\\'s been so close,\" Rasheed said. \"What more does he have to do? Well, it\\'s not a matter of big changes. It\\'s just been a matter of points and the moments. \" It\\'s a matter of the opposition, too. The first of Murray\\'s Australian Open defeats in the final came against Roger Federer in 2010. The last four came against Djokovic in 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2016. \"Andy played Roger in his prime and has been playing Novak in his prime,\" Rasheed said. \"It\\'s a handful of points changing the way the match falls. Andy\\'s showing he\\'s in his prime now. He just needs to get there and roll the dice again. \" Murray\\'s timing may still not be quite right. He played a great deal of tennis down the stretch in 2016 and was beaten by Djokovic in a final in Doha, Qatar, to start this season. Freshness just might be a factor down the stretch as well as Djokovic\\'s eagerness to restore the pecking order. But it does not seem quite right in light of their abilities that Djokovic has six Australian Open titles and Murray has not even one. He broke down in tears after losing to Federer in 2010. He stared vacantly into space after losses to Djokovic and sportingly came up with the right words amid major disappointment. And yet he insisted on Monday that his emotions were not mixed when he thought about this tournament. \"Honestly, they\\'re totally positive,\" said Murray, who plays Andrey Rublev in the second round on Wednesday. \"I\\'ve had a lot of tough losses here, for sure. But I love it here. Played some great matches as well, but just haven\\'t managed to win the final. But, you know, I keep coming back to try. I\\'ll keep doing that until I\\'m done, but I still feel like I\\'ve got a few years left to try and do it. \" He is, by any measure, due for a change of fortune in Melbourne. And if you like your sports with foreshadowing, the only other top tennis player to receive a knighthood was Sir Norman Brookes, the Australian star of the early 20th century. Guess whose name has been given to the trophy awarded to the men\\'s champion at the Australian Open?',\n",

              " 'The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\\'s watchdog is expanding a review of administrator Scott Pruitt\\'s frequent travels to his home state Oklahoma to include more recent trips taken on military and charter flights, according to a memo seen on Friday. The Office of Inspector General had been investigating the \"frequency, cost and extent\" of Pruitt\\'s travels to Oklahoma through July 31, and will now expand the \"active audit\" to include all travel, including the use of private and military flights he has taken up to Sept. 30. The expanded review coincides with heightened scrutiny surrounding the travels of President Donald Trump\\'s cabinet officials with reports that some have spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for non-commercial flights. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price resigned last week over his use of costly private charter planes for government business. The Interior Department\\'s own inspector general last week confirmed it also opened an investigation into travels by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke after receiving numerous complaints about his use of three chartered flights, including one on an aircraft owned by an oil and gas executive. Energy Secretary Rick Perry also used a private charter flight last week, Reuters reported. The flight cost $11,000, according to travel records provided to Reuters by the Department of Energy. The records show that Perry took four non-commercial flights between May and last week totaling nearly $56,000 of taxpayer money. Department spokeswoman Shaylyn Hayes said in a statement on Friday that in the \"rare instances where government-owned or chartered aircraft have been used, trips were pre-approved by an Ethics officer within the Office of General Counsel.\" Separately, a spokeswoman for the Energy Department\\'s inspector general office could not confirm nor deny whether it is investigating his travels.

Since then, the two companies have communicated on 11 separate occasions, each time with TWC rejecting Charter's advances. It is certainly interesting to ask whether this proposed acquisition will take place, and we think we know the answer to that, but there is a more important question at stake which is - what will be the source of long-term value in a future merged company? There are only four potential sources of value in a cable network operator: The network (i.e. the physical infrastructure used to distribute the content from the network operations centre to the customer's premises); The content (i.e. programming that the cable network operator owns and can therefore license to other distributors); Ancillary services that can be delivered using the cable network (e.g. high-speed internet and phone service); Value-added services that span multiple connected devices and allow the user to enjoy their services and content on an 'anytime, anywhere' basis. Read on to find out which of these four sources of value will provide lasting value, and also why the cable network operator of the future will be forced into doing deals with OTT players like Netflix, Google, Apple and others.

Just earlier today, Eystein and I were soliciting approval from our team on how to best get feedback from chapter authors - Lead Authors and Contributing Authors alike. Since we\\'re all authors, it isn\\'t appropriate to comment officially as expert reviewers, but rather to work as a team to take expert reviews - AND chapter 6 author feedback - and use them to create a better finalo draft. One key, as promised earlier, is to have a process that makes sure we get all comments and are able to respond to them. The other key is that we ensure time to allow the needed debate. Eystein and I are going to ask LAs (including Keith) to do there work sooner in the draft cycle than before so that we have the time for this. So... I would suggest you keep these comments in a safe place for a bit longer, and then send them in to the Eystein and I when we ask (should be in the next week). Note that the current draft has only officially been available for a bit over a week (indeed, I didn\\'t see it until today since the IPCC TSU had to check for all sorts of things after we submitted it over a month ago), and we won\\'t be working on the new draft until June.

The prime minister said Britain would continue to provide assistance to states that were victims of aggression. The UK will remain unconditionally committed to maintaining Europe s security, May said in a speech at the Guildhall in London s financial district. The comprehensive new economic partnership we seek will underpin our shared commitment to open economies and free societies in the face of those who seek to undermine them. The British government is playing one its strongest cards in the Brexit negotiations by offering to put its defense and security assets at the disposal of the EU in the hope of winning concessions on future trading and economic relations. The country has bigger defense budgets than any other EU member state and its diplomatic and intelligence services are among the most extensive in Europe. Its government also argues it is one of the leading EU contributors to a range of security measures, such as data and evidence sharing, extradition measures and to the EU s police agency Europol. May on Monday accused Russia of fomenting violence in eastern Ukraine, of repeatedly violating the national airspace of several European countries, and mounting a campaign of cyber attacks. She also accused Russia of meddling in elections and hacking the Danish defense ministry, the German parliament and its state-media of planting fake stories and photo-shopped images in an attempt to undermine western institutions. May said the government is working to reform NATO so it is better placed to counter Russian hostility and has stepped up military and economic support to Ukraine. We will take the necessary actions to counter Russian activity, she said. May also said she wanted better relations with Russia if it worked to promote peace.

[Three of the four officers were white King, who died in 2012, was black. (Two officers were later convicted in a federal civil rights trial.) As Bay Area public radio station KQED recalls: Fury over the acquittal â€” stoked by years of racial and economic inequality in the city â€” spilled over into the streets, resulting in five days of rioting in Los Angeles. It ignited a national conversation about racial and economic disparity and police use of force that continues today. â€¦ The acquittals were announced around 3 p. m. less than three hours later, the unrest began. Residents set fires, looted and destroyed liquor stores, grocery stores, retail shops and fast food restaurants. motorists â€” both white and Latino â€” were targeted some were pulled out of their cars and beaten. The reaction to the acquittal in South Central Los Angeles â€” now known just as South Los Angeles â€” was particularly violent. At the time, more than half of the population there was black. Tension had already been mounting in the neighborhood in the years leading up to the riots: the unemployment rate was about 50 percent, a drug epidemic was ravaging the area, and gang activity and violent crime were high. During the riots, a white trucker, Reginald Denny, was nearly beaten to death by gang members, and footage of the beating was captured overhead. Four black bystanders intervened and saved Denny by driving him to the hospital. In the years since then, there has been significant improvement in the relationship between the LAPD and minority communities in the city. For that reason, the marches of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2014 caught many observers by surprise.

              " 'A New Paradigm for Diagnosis and Treatment of Modern Chronic Illnesses Dr. Judy Mikovits  by John P. Thomas Health Impact News  The persistent investigation of Dr. Mikovits into the cause and treatment of modern illnesses, along with a handful of other scientists and healthcare providers such as the late Dr. Jeff Bradstreet, M.D., is leading us toward a new understanding of modern illness and its treatment.  Dr. Mikovits sees the bigger picture of health and illness that few scientists and healthcare providers have the courage to examine. She had great respect for the work of Dr. Bradstreet and his successful use of the new paradigm for treating difficult illnesses. Dr. Mikovits stated:  Dr. Bradstreet recognized that what we call autism is in fact an acquired immune deficiency. What we know of as autism is part of a collection of more than 60 diseases that is spiraling and increasing in our environment.  It is acquired immune deficiency resulting from all the toxins, all the vaccines and other contaminants in our environment from these biologicals that in fact means that what we know of as autism spectrum disorder is an acquired immune deficiency. [1] A Family of Acquired Immune Deficiency Diseases  Many who read this may be initially confused or may even balk at the use of the term Acquired Immune Deficiency , because of the association with HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS is one of many acquired immune deficiency syndromes (diseases). It is an acquired immune deficiency caused by the virus that is commonly called HIV. However, HIV is not the only acquired immune deficiency disease â€“ there are more than 60 others, which can result in non-HIV AIDS.  When the human immune system is repeatedly stressed and weakened by toxic food, by toxins in the environment, and by toxic vaccines, then chronic retrovirus related illnesses can begin to emerge from their slumber. We can give a general name to all these illnesses. We can simply call them Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes or non-HIV AIDS.  The conventional healthcare system struggles to accurately diagnose these modern diseases, because there are so many overlapping sets of symptoms. Beyond the specific symptoms is the same underlying problem, which is immune system dysregulation and dysfunction.  People with these diseases have immune systems that have been pushed to the max by various stressors. Their immune systems have been pushed to the point of breakage where retroviral infections can be released from their confinement and begin to reproduce in the body.  Once this happens, the immune system is no longer able to adequately respond to the insults that it was formerly able to control. Various immune system pathways keep trying to fix the situation, but can\\'t overcome the damage.  An acquired immune deficiency is simply an immune system that has been broken to such a degree that it cannot properly respond to the conditions that are causing illness. It is so broken that it cannot even repair itself. The result of such severe immune dysfunction is chronic disabling illness. The Central Tenet of Modern Chronic Illnesses  Dr. Mikovits explains more about the new understanding of the immune system and the paradigm shift that is leading healthcare providers to reconsider long-held assumptions about health and illness. It is causing them to rethink what it means to bring about a \"cure\" for modern illnesses. Dr. Mikovits stated:  The paradigm shift was recognizing that the macrophage was the central tenet of disease. Our central hypothesis, which we have held for more than three decades, is that there is a critical threshold of immune activation, and when the activation rises above that level, damage to the immune system is being created. Damage is created at a distance.  The damage may be subclinical and it will create imbalance not only in the macrophages, but also in other parts of the immune system. What we want to do is to stop this process.  We want to stop the disease engine, stop the microbial switch from turning on the oxidative stress, and turning on the inflammatory cytokines â€” and doing this over and over again. If we can limit the damage to the subsets of the immune system, then it is possible to modulate and rebalance the immune system and cure the disease. [2] The Power of the Immune System can Heal Modern Diseases  The new paradigm offers the possibility of true cure, because it relies on the power of the human immune system to bring about a cure. Cure is not seen as the eradication of pathogens by pharmaceutical drugs or other means, rather, the goal is to restore the immune system so that it can once again control or manage pathogens.  In the case of retroviral infection such as HIV, HTLV-1 Leukemia virus, and others, these viruses cannot be eradicated from the body once they have imbedded themselves into human DNA. Once retroviruses have inserted themselves into cells, they cannot be removed â€“ they are there for life.  This means that successful treatments will need to prevent further viral reproduction and enable the immune system to control the existing viral load. When this is done, then the symptoms of disease subside and people are able to live normal lives again.  The illnesses we are discussing first appeared after the dawn of the genetic age or they had a sudden increase in prevalence since it began. Many of these diseases were once considered only diseases of the elderly; but today they are appearing in children and even in newborn babies. This is especially true for cancer.  We are seeing babies born with cancer, two-year-olds dying of cancer, children being unable to digest food, teens dropping dead while playing sports, children with severe physical and intellectual delays, young adults in their twenties with disabling neurological failure, people in their 40s and 50s with deteriorating brain function and memory loss, and people of all ages developing brain fog and physical weakness to the point where they can no longer work or even take care of themselves.  Such things were virtually unheard of before the dawning of the genetic Age. The Bad Fruit of the Genetic Age  The diseases listed below are some of the illnesses that are associated with retroviral infection and immune system damage. We cannot say these diseases are caused by retroviruses, but only that retroviruses are often expressed in patients who have these diseases. Aberrant retrovirus expression and a compromised immune system are the common threads that link these diseases together. The prevalence of these diseases has increased dramatically over the past four decades.  Illnesses Associated with Retroviral Infection [3]  Cancers: Prostate, Breast, Lymphoma, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Mantle Cell Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell Leukemia, Hairy Cell Leukemia, Liver, Bladder, Kidney, Pancreas, Colorectal, Ovarian, and Non-Hodgkin\\'s Lymphoma.  Auto-Immune Diseases: Rheumatoid Arthritis, Lupus, Crohn\\'s Disease, Peripheral Neuropathy, Primary Biliary Cirrhosis, Sjogren\\'s Syndrome, Hashimoto\\'s Thyroiditis, Polymyositis, and Bechet\\'s Disease.  Neuro-Immune Diseases: Myalgic Encephalomyelitis or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), Multiple Sclerosis, Fibromyalgia, Gulf-War Syndrome, Morgellons Disease, treatment resistant Lyme disease, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).  Central Nervous System Diseases: Alzheimer\\'s, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, multiple system atrophy, Autism Spectrum Disorders, and Parkinson\\'s.  A central sign of immune system dysfunction in these diseases is extreme fatigue. Many people also note unexplained weight loss or gain. These symptoms are early warning signs of cancer, but also are hallmarks of all the other diseases mentioned above.  In addition, there will be: signs of inflammation, significant hormone dysregulation, highly elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), highly elevated reactive nitrogen species (RNS), changes in gene expression without a change to DNA (epigenetics), actual changes in DNA through the process of insertional mutagenesis in which exogenous genetic material is incorporated within the DNA of a host, and serious immune system deficiency. Proper Treatment of Immune System Dysfunction can Help Patients  This is a grim reality that Dr. Mikovits has been working to change.  The proper treatment of immune system dysfunction can help patients with these types of illnesses. These types of treatments enable the body\\'s normal immune defenses to take up their task and gain control over out-of-control situations in the body. Multiple Factors are Causing Illness and Death in Our Modern Age  These are some of the major factors that work together to damage immune system functioning. Alterations in human DNA caused by the presence of retroviruses, Opportunistic co-infections that accompany retroviral infections, Vaccines and most pharmaceutical drugs, Highly processed food and its toxic ingredients such as GMOs, glyphosate, preservatives, artificial flavorings, hydrogenated oil products, etc., Electromagnetic pollution, Toxic chemical exposure in the environment, Chlorinated and fluoridated drinking water, Biologically inactive and chemically contaminated agricultural soil, Antibiotics and incompatible GMO feed given to animals raised in confined feeding operations, Toxins and artificial fragrances in cleaning products and body care products, Mold infested homes and schools, and Of course, the high sugar and high carbohydrate diet.  These factors, plus many others, which are common to \"modern life\" in America, interact synergistically to damage the immune system. The combined harm is much higher than would be expected by simply adding the potential dangers together. Over time, the stress they produce on the immune system will cause it to crash, and one or more of the illnesses listed above will manifest.  Conventional physicians cannot seem to accept the reality that the modern diseases that plague the world today are linked to multiple factors. They have trouble believing there is synergy between these factors, and that together they could be disrupting the human immune system to the point where disease results. Question for Dr. Mikovits  Is Your Approach Really New?  Basically what I am describing is old-fashioned medicine, and it is rarely done anymore. There are some, of course, who do use these protocols. We need to look at the patient. Talk to the patient. Look at the family. That is what we do. That\\'s what we have always done.  Based on the fact that damage to the immune system is associated with a complex set of interconnected factors, many of which cannot be clearly assessed, then is it reasonable to think that the selection of treatment options needs to be based more on the dysfunctions in immune system pathways, than on the potential triggers of the dysfunction?  Yes, that is correct.  There are any number of therapies â€“ both natural products and otherwise â€“ that could be put together to address immune system dysfunction. But, there is no simple fix. Physicians tend to want to just hand a patient an antidepressant, which is not going to work, or give Lyrica or pain medication, which is going to mask the problem. Even steroids mask the problem and prevent immune system functioning, and down the road a few years things are going to get even worse and spin out of control.  Treating these patients is a lot like the protocol we used for treating AIDS patients. If the AIDS patient had TB or mycoplasma we couldn\\'t treat the retrovirus first. We had to clear the terrain. We had to stop some of the other overwhelming infections and prevent the downstream effects on their bodies. Otherwise, they couldn\\'t respond to the treatment. What we learned that was most significant was to never let the CD4 T cells get too low, because if they get too low then patients can\\'t respond to antiretroviral or antimicrobial treatments.  We are also learning which microbes in the human microbiome are key to drug responses, because they modulate the immune system, interferon and things like that.  Most people want natural products for their illnesses. Baicalin, medical marijuana, vitamin D binding protein (GcMAF), and HEEL Lymphomyosot are some of the natural products that we have studied. The New Paradigm must Address Vaccines and Vaccine Injury  Big Pharma and the government scientists who do their will want us to believe that the science regarding vaccine safety is settled, and the current vaccination schedule is safe. However, some scientists object to this conclusion and insist that the science is not settled and the schedule is not safe!  In fact, the science that has been produced since 2010 concerning vaccines is unsettling Big Pharma. It contradicts their past conclusions and is threatening their profitability.  Agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have lost touch with their original mandates to protect and serve the public. These U.S. government regulators continue to ignore the new science and pursue an informal program that discredits scientists who expose the harmful nature of current vaccines, and they discredit those who dare to criticize the CDC\\'s recommended vaccine schedule.  As we saw with the MMR vaccine, the FDA knowingly approves vaccines and drugs when research shows a high potential for harm, and even destroys data and alters its findings for the sake of keeping its corporate funders happy. [4] While the FDA is keeping its head buried in the sand, the CDC is promoting a schedule of childhood vaccination which has caused harm to millions of children.  Despite this level of corruption, strong voices can be heard from outside the corporate and regulatory world declaring the truth about vaccines and their schedule of administration.  Among the voices raising concern about the safety of vaccines and their schedule of administration is the respectful voice of scientist Dr. Judy A. Mikovits, Ph.D. She continues to speak out on the mechanisms of immune system injury and the treatments for retroviral and vaccine related illness. Her clear voice is a wake-up call to all people who value health freedom and independent thinking.  Her teaching is life-enriching, because she is addressing the needs of real people with serious illness, and is speaking directly to doctors who are beginning to realize they need new tools to understand and treat the modern illnesses of their patients.  Her teaching is not anti-vaccine, because Dr. Mikovits is not anti-vaccine. However, Dr. Mikovits is not afraid to raise serious questions about the safety of the vaccines being used today. She is not afraid to give a strong warning about the vaccine schedule used for infants and children, and will not remain silent about the lack of wisdom associated with vaccinating pregnant women and seniors.  Dr. Mikovits allows the science to speak. She works hard to avoid standing on the pro-vaccine or anti-vaccine soapbox. Instead, she quietly asks us to use our intelligence to make decisions concerning the use of vaccines based on everything that is known about the functioning of the human immune system and its reaction to vaccines. Dr. Mikovits is Challenging All of Us to Wake Up  Dr. Mikovits is inserting a healthy dose of common sense into the discussion of vaccine safety. She stated:  You will hear, \"the science is settled, vaccines are safe.\" They aren\\'t safe. What science is settled? We learn new things every day!  Dr. Mikovits is challenging all of us to wake up.  Physicians are being challenged to think twice whenever they consider recommending that all their patients receive vaccines according to the schedule promoted by the CDC. The general public is being challenged to think twice before agreeing to receive vaccines or permit vaccines to be given to their children. Patients are being challenged to engage their physicians in a dialogue about the potential harm that might result from being vaccinated, because vaccine injury is a real possibility whenever a vaccine is given, and the use of clever marketing slogans such as \"the science is settled\" does not remove the possibility of vaccine injury.

Medical Doctors Opposed to Forced Vaccinations â€“ Should Their Views be Silenced? eBook â€“ Available for immediate download.  One of the biggest myths being propagated in the compliant mainstream media today is that doctors are either pro-vaccine or anti-vaccine, and that the anti-vaccine doctors are all \"quacks.\"  However, nothing could be further from the truth in the vaccine debate. Doctors are not unified at all on their positions regarding \"the science\" of vaccines, nor are they unified in the position of removing informed consent to a medical procedure like vaccines.  The two most extreme positions are those doctors who are 100% against vaccines and do not administer them at all, and those doctors that believe that ALL vaccines are safe and effective for ALL people, ALL the time, by force if necessary.  Very few doctors fall into either of these two extremist positions, and yet it is the extreme pro-vaccine position that is presented by the U.S. Government and mainstream media as being the dominant position of the medical field.  In between these two extreme views, however, is where the vast majority of doctors practicing today would probably categorize their position. Many doctors who consider themselves \"pro-vaccine,\" for example, do not believe that every single vaccine is appropriate for every single individual.  Many doctors recommend a \"delayed\" vaccine schedule for some patients, and not always the recommended one-size-fits-all CDC childhood schedule. Other doctors choose to recommend vaccines based on the actual science and merit of each vaccine, recommending some, while determining that others are not worth the risk for children, such as the suspect seasonal flu shot.  These doctors who do not hold extreme positions would be opposed to government-mandated vaccinations and the removal of all parental exemptions.  In this eBook, I am going to summarize the many doctors today who do not take the most extremist pro-vaccine position, which is probably not held by very many doctors at all, in spite of what the pharmaceutical industry, the federal government, and the mainstream media would like the public to believe.

              " \"I'd like to say I really liked these 'jumbo' dinosaurs. But they are not even jumbo at all. They aren't tiny, but by far jumbo.They are all less than 6 inches in length, and being this smaller size isn't really the big problem. What bugs me about this set, or at least the one that I received, is that there are 4 duplicate dinos. Not just the same dinosaur in a different pose, but I mean 4 exact duplicates. When I pay for 12 dinosaurs, I expect at least 12 dinosaurs in different poses, regardless if there is an occasional same dinosaur, but not 12 dinosaurs with 4 having an exact duplicate twin. The quality is not the worst I have seen before, however in many I can clearly see the mold imprint melted into the dinos. So several look like they have had an operation, and split entirely apart and melted back together. But, what do you expect from anything now days that has 'Made In China' stamped on the bottom. Overall, I'll rate these 3 stars, and lucky they get that. Would not recommend to toddlers, but only kids 5 and up, and expect them to cry when they get 4 exact duplicate dinosaurs.\",\n",

I am generally happy with all the Little People sets I have and this is a great addition. I love how they designed it to look like a preschool with a teacher and 2 students, which you can add your other little people to the set also. The art easel, fish aquarium, round rug, hamster wheel, table/chairs, and slide are all items that make up a great preschool setting! The magical color rug doesn\\'t really teach colors but sounds of each musical instrument which can be combined with pressing one other band instrument. The center of the rug is the teachers voice where she asks different questions and has a short conversation with you like; \"It\\'s time for Ms. Hugs magical rug! what can you find? Come back soon!\" I didn\\'t rate it 5 stars because although it states on the box over 35 sounds, phrases and songs, it seems half that amount. There should be more phrases added and could see this toy being tiresome after a short while. So I think I\\'ll put it away and bring it out every couple weeks for a short time to play with so that it remains a \"new\" feeling toy. Overall, this Little People preschool set is a lot of fun which offers lots of opportunities to learn and pretend play.

              " 'On Wednesday, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will consider Donald J. Trump\\'s choice of Scott Pruitt, Oklahoma\\'s attorney general since 2011, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Pruitt spent much of his time in office fighting the Obama administration over the E. P. A. \\'s actions to regulate air and water pollution and to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The committee is led by Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, an outspoken contrarian on climate change, and includes several Republicans openly hostile to federal action to address it. The Democratic members of the committee include some of the Senate\\'s strongest supporters of the E. P. A. and most forceful voices for decisive action on climate change. We asked readers what questions they would ask if they could question Mr. Pruitt. More than 2, 000 replied, and their answers largely fell into a few categories. Here is what some of them would like to know. Many readers seemed familiar with Mr. Pruitt\\'s statement that the science of climate change is \"far from settled. \" Most pointed out that an overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that climate change is happening and is caused by human activity, specifically by the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and asked for Mr. Pruitt\\'s sources for his position. Seth Rudman, 28, a scientific researcher at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, asked, \"Can you describe the shortcomings of the scientific evidence for climate change and the type of data that would be needed to convince you that climate change is happening?\" While being a scientist is not a requirement for the job, readers worried about what having a climate denialist at the top might mean for the agency. \"During the Bush administration, climate scientists, including Dr. James Hansen, claimed that their voices were suppressed and their reports changed to minimize the role of humans in accelerating climate change and its impact,\" wrote Donald Chartier, 60, the founder and chief executive of an internet company in Chicago. \"Can you assure us that E. P. A. scientists will be allowed to present scientific evidence and data freely to the American people, without retaliation?\" Others focused on the risk Mr. Pruitt was taking by denying the risks of climate change. \"If the scientific consensus on climate change proves correct and the changes in the Earth\\'s weather cause widespread devastation, loss of life and property and great economic damage, who should be held responsible for staying the actions that might have prevented or ameliorated these outcomes?\" asked Joseph Griffin, 72, a retiree from Bellefonte, Pa. During his time as attorney general of Oklahoma, Mr. Pruitt has been seen by some to be cozy with the fossil fuel industry. He filed 14 suits against the E. P. A. challenging the agency\\'s environmental regulations, looking to soften the blow of federal policies against oil, gas, agriculture and other interests. In 13 of those cases, companies that had contributed money to Mr. Pruitt or to political campaign committees also signed on. Readers were concerned that Mr. Pruitt might continue to advance the interests of industry, possibly to the detriment of public health and safety. \"How do you intend to serve the public need to protect the environment when you have demonstrated a preference for the rights of corporate shareholders?\" asked Alison ten Cate, 50, an energy efficiency consultant from Belmont, Calif. Others wrote that Mr. Pruitt should be asked if he would be willing to disclose the companies and lobbyists that have given money to his campaigns, and agree to recuse himself from decisions involving them. Mr. Pruitt has argued that states are in a better position to regulate their environment and industries than the federal government, which he has accused of overreach. Many readers argued that air and water do not respect state borders, so it is the federal government\\'s responsibility to regulate these interstate issues. \"You have worked against the E. P. A. in favor of managing interstate and global issues at the state level. Why?\" asked Charles Haddox, 59, a marketing manager in Denver. \"What success stories can you relate in detail showing states are more successful at protecting resources in the absence of federal regulation?\" They also wondered where the limits of Mr. Pruitt\\'s federalism might lie. \"Does your belief in federalism mean you will not interfere with the efforts of California and other states to address climate change?\" wrote Michael McCabe, 19, a student at Sarah Lawrence College. \"Or will you serve the interests of the fossil fuel industry and interfere with states\\' efforts?\" Some asked practical questions, like Mavis 65, a teacher and naturalist in Memphis, who wanted to know how Mr. Pruitt could continue to push for state and local jurisdiction of clean air and water \"in light of the Flint, Mich. water scandal. \" High levels of lead were found in the city\\'s water supply, largely a result of state and local regulatory failures, and the federal government had to intervene (some argue too late). Several readers seemed puzzled at why Mr. Pruitt would want to run a federal regulatory agency if he saw federal regulations as a problem, and wondered if he had other ideas for how to regulate pollutants. Some also would like to hear examples of success on environmental issues from his time in office in Oklahoma. Mark Baker, 48, an American who works for Diageo, an international beverage company, in Brussels, asked, \"Can you provide an example of a policy that originated at the state or local level under your watch in Oklahoma and that resulted in cleaner water or air for Oklahoma\\'s citizens?\" \"Do you believe in protecting water, air and land from pollution?\" wrote Sabina Gasper, 55, who works for the pharmaceutical industry in Bismarck, N. D. \"Do you believe that regulations are the way to do this? If not, how should these resources be protected?\" Some struck a more hopeful tone, like Lilian Howard, \"nearing 80 years of age,\" a retired travel consultant and writer from Virginia Beach, who wrote, \"Would you briefly discuss a few actions by the E. P. A. which you believe were successful in protecting the American people and their natural surroundings from harm and how you might hope we can improve upon these during the new administration?\"',\n",

              " 'Venezuela\\'s socialist dictator NicolÃ¡s Maduro claimed on national television Saturday that the nation\\'s opposition was \"murdering its own protesters,\" listing individuals killed by Venezuelan soldiers and Chavista gangs and blaming the leadership of the opposition for staging the deaths to garner support for their cause. [Maduro did not present any evidence to justify his claim. \"These protests today are only in one percent of the nation,\" Maduro claimed on state television. \"They are more violent than ever, you have all seen cases where they have murdered their own protesters. \" He listed three cases of alleged staged murders, two shot to death and a third allegedly electrocuted. \"If it weren\\'t for Julio Borges and the MUD none of these tragedies would have happened,\" he alleged. Borges is the president of the National Assembly, the federal legislative body, and a party leader in the coalition known as the Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD). He has personally been the victim of state violence, beaten by a Chavista gang (colectivo) near the entrance of the National Assembly building in 2016. The gang succeeded in breaking his nose. Maduro also blamed Borges personally in a separate video segment for allegedly sending a gang to kidnap a bus driver. Maduro did not explain who kidnapped the driver or why, but by Monday, Venezuelan state television was showcasing a photo opportunity with Maduro and the driver, identified as Leonardo Leconte, on its online front page. At least 39 people have been killed in this most recent wave of protests, which began in March following an attempt by the Supreme Court to nullify the National Assembly and establish itself as the chief lawmaking body. The Venezuelan newspaper El Universal lists among them two of the most recent cases that align with the descriptions Maduro used in his remarks: Miguel Fernando Castillo Bracho, 27, and Anderson Dugarte, 38, who were both shot to death. The odds of opposition members being responsible for these shootings are barely existent, however, because of Venezuela\\'s strict laws. The opposition is almost completely unarmed, as the private ownership of firearms is banned. Only criminal gangs and colectivos, some of whom operate as official paramilitaries, have the firearms used in these circumstances. In 2014, Maduro opened \"disarmament centers\" to pressure the few remaining civilians possessing weapons to return them. Three years later, Maduro promised a firearm to every Chavista who swore to use them against the opposition, setting a goal of distributing one million firearms to \"militiamen\" working for the government. Many other protester deaths cannot be explained as deeds of the opposition. Among the most notable are the protesters the military has killed on Maduro\\'s orders. In one particularly gruesome incident caught on video, soldiers ran unarmed protesters over using large armored vehicles, killing at least three. Others among the 39 died without even meaning to protest, among them Ricarda GonzÃ¡lez, who died asphyxiated by tear gas in her home. Only the military has access to tear gas and has used it liberally against protesters. Maduro\\'s claim that the opposition is killing their own people recalls propaganda tactics used by its allies in the Middle East. The government of Iran, a longtime Chavista ally, has been particularly bold in denying violence that investigators have traced back to them. In 2015, when Uruguayan officials accused the Iranian government of using employees at its embassy to plant explosives near the Israeli embassy in Montevideo, Iranian officials accused Israel of bombing its own embassy to \"create Iranophobia and tarnish the Islamic Republic\\'s international image. \" \"Tehran has said in the past that Tel Aviv has ordered attacks against its own embassies in India and Georgia in order to damage Iran\\'s image in the host countries,\" the Iranian government said at the time. Similarly, another ally of Tehran\\'s, Syria\\'s Bashar has accused Syrian rebels of attacking its own to frame his government for assorted human rights abuses. Following a Syrian government chemical weapons attack on civilians in April, Assad said the United States and Syrian rebels \"fabricated the whole story in order to have a pretext for the attack [a U. S. airstrike against the Syrian air force]. \" Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.',\n",

Asked about a Friday morning tweet in which Trump said the U.S. ban on travelers from certain countries should be more specific, Trump said: We have to be tougher and we have to be smarter. (This story corrects third paragraph to show Trump was referring to the U.S. travel ban in his quote, not the London attack.)',\n",

The color is fantastic. Because these are made from sterilized human hair they don't have that glossy look synthetic ones usually do and are gorgeous with a generous application of mascara to maximize volume, if you desire (which is what I did in my photo). Because these have a spaced out lash line on the band to look like your very own fringe they look somewhat toothy on the lid up close which is easily solved by a swipe of dark shadow or a smokey eyeliner.

              " 'On Tuesday Hunter Jackson was suspended for seven days after bringing an empty . 22 shell casing to school to show his friends. [Hunter\\'s school â€” A Place to Grow â€” is located in Troy, Illinois. According to Fox 2 Now, Hunter\\'s mother, Kristy Jackson, said her son was excited because he had just spent time with his grandpa â€” a Caseyville, Illinois, police officer â€” who was teaching him about hunting and gun safety. Jackson said: [Hunter] just was wandering around in a field and picked up and put it in his pocket and didn\\'t tell his parents â€¦ it\\'s paranoia. It\\'s something that\\'s become quite an epidemic where guns are automatically assumed that they\\'re bad â€¦ and I\\'m not sure how a suspension teaches my son anything about tolerance or anything about why he was wrong. It just means his school doesn\\'t want him there because of things he enjoys. In a Facebook post, Jackson she went to the school to pick her son up like any other day, only to met by \"a stone faced teacher\" who said her son had brought a \"shotgun bullet\" to school. Jackson said her immediate thought was, \"My kid? Who just spent the weekend learning gun safety?\" She said the teacher then handed her a letter saying \"[Hunter\\'s] behavior warranted a seven school day suspension. Which [Kristy] still was expected to pay tuition for, of course. And a threat that if his enthusiasm for guns continued, he\\'d be permanently expelled. \" Fox 2 Now reports that the letter also said the school had \"repeatedly\" told Hunter to quit \"using other toys as make believe guns\" The school\\'s also emailed Jackson to inform her that he was \"notifying the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS)\" about the suspension.

              " 'In blunt testimony revealed on Tuesday, former managers of Trump University, the school started by Donald J. Trump, portray it as an unscrupulous business that relied on sales tactics, employed unqualified instructors, made deceptive claims and exploited vulnerable students willing to pay tens of thousands for Mr. Trump\\'s insights. One sales manager for Trump University, Ronald Schnackenberg, recounted how he was reprimanded for not pushing a financially struggling couple hard enough to sign up for a $35, 000 real estate class, despite his conclusion that it would endanger their economic future. He watched with disgust, he said, as a fellow Trump University salesman persuaded the couple to purchase the class anyway. \"I believe that Trump University was a fraudulent scheme,\" Mr. Schnackenberg wrote in his testimony, \"and that it preyed upon the elderly and uneducated to separate them from their money. \" For Mr. Trump, whose presidential campaign hinges on his reputation as a businessman, the newly unsealed documents offer an unflattering snapshot of his career since branching out, over the past decade, from building skyscrapers into endeavors that cashed in on his name to sell everything from water and steaks to ties and education. The release of the documents on Tuesday, under court order, was the latest turn in a federal lawsuit, filed in California by dissatisfied former Trump University students, that has bedeviled the businessman since 2010 and could trail him into the White House if he is elected president. Mr. Trump, who started the university in 2005, owned 93 percent of the company. From the start, he acted as its chief promoter, rather than manager, selling it as a tool of financial empowerment that would improve life for thousands of ordinary Americans. It would, he said, \"teach you better than the best business school,\" according to the transcript of a Web video. Within the documents made public Tuesday were internal employee guides encouraging customers with little money to pay for the tuition with their credit cards. \"We teach the technique of using OPM . .. Other People\\'s Money,\" explained the internal instructions for salespeople. The documents pushed employees to exploit the emotions of potential customers. \"Let them know you\\'ve found an answer to their problems,\" read confidential instructions to salespeople. The most striking documents were written testimony from former employees of Trump University who said they had become disenchanted with the university\\'s tactics and culture. Corrine Sommer, an event manager, recounted how colleagues encouraged students to open up as many credit cards as possible to pay for classes that many of them could not afford. \"It\\'s O. K. just max out your credit card,\" Ms. Sommer recalled their saying. Jason Nicholas, a sales executive at Trump University, recalled a deceptive pitch used to lure students â€” that Mr. Trump would be \"actively involved\" in their education. \"This was not true,\" Mr. Nicholas testified, saying Mr. Trump was hardly involved at all. Trump University, Mr. Nicholas concluded, was \"a facade, a total lie. \" Lawyers for Mr. Trump on Tuesday challenged those characterizations, saying that the testimony of the former Trump University employees \"was completely discredited\" in depositions taken for the California lawsuit. Lawyers for Mr. Trump declined to release those depositions on Tuesday. As he has in the past, Mr. Trump argued through representatives that the complaints emanated from a small number of former students and that the vast majority had offered positive reviews of their experience. \"Trump University looks forward to using this evidence, along with much more, to win when the case is brought before a jury,\" said Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump. The court records show the role that Mr. Trump â€” and his outsize reputation â€” played in trying to sell the real estate classes to thousands of students. Marketing materials bearing his signature encouraged prospective students to take advantage of a downturn in the housing market to earn quick profits. He offered the kind of assurances that financial advisers have long cautioned consumers to be wary of. \"How would you like to your financial future,\" Mr. Trump asked in one brochure. Mr. Trump started the Trump University just as the overheated American housing market neared its peak, promising that its classes would impart his wisdom about real estate and moneymaking to the general public. But dozens of complaints about the school rolled into the offices of attorneys general in Florida, Texas, New York and Illinois, officials said, prompting multiple investigations and, eventually, the lawsuit from former students in California. Mr. Trump had fought Tuesday\\'s release of previously sealed documents in the case. In an apparent attempt to discredit the judge in the case, Gonzalo P. Curiel, Mr. Trump called him biased and a \"hater of Donald Trump,\" and he sought to draw attention to the judge\\'s ethnic background â€” \"we believe Mexican,\" Mr. Trump said. (Mr. Curiel was born in Indiana he is of Mexican descent.) On Friday, in response to a legal motion filed by The Washington Post, Judge Curiel ruled that the records be released. Some of the documents unsealed Tuesday were previously made public in connection with other lawsuits. The internal guidebooks for employees of Trump University provide a detailed set of instructions for how to sell the classes, even to skeptical and reluctant consumers, by tapping into their psychological needs. A chart outlines the stages of the \"roller coaster of emotions\" that a buyer will experience. (The \"Blast\" phase, it explains, is \"giving your clients hope again. \" The \"Probe\" phase, it says, must \"slowly bring the client back down to reality. \") When it comes to selling the classes, the guidebooks leave little to chance. Inside the rooms where students are asked to enroll in classes, workers are asked to \"confirm that room temperature is no more than 68 degrees. \" Of course, Mr. Trump and the promise of his engagement with the school was the biggest draw of all. In the documents released Tuesday, instructors described themselves as \" \" by Mr. Trump. But in a deposition related to the lawsuit, Mr. Trump acknowledged that he did not pick the instructors. Not all the documents made public on Tuesday were critical. Many former students said the classes delivered exactly what they had expected. \"Trump University definitely made me more prepared to tackle the \\'real world\\' of real estate investing,\" wrote David Wright Jr. who signed up for a program. \"We really learned a lot of from Trump University and have found a modicum of success,\" wrote another student, Kissy Gordon. Former employees like Ms. Sommer took a dimmer view of the school. In her testimony, she said she was startled by the qualifications of some Trump University instructors. Ms. Sommer recalled that a member of the Trump University sales team, who had previously sold jewelry, was promoted to become an instructor. He had \"no real estate experience,\" she said. She added that many of the instructors had the quality that the school seemed to value most: \"They were skilled at sales,\" she said.',\n",

              " 'The United States is crafting a plan for a drawdown of staff from the American embassy in Havana in response to still-unexplained incidents that have harmed the health of some U.S. diplomats there, U.S. and congressional officials said on Thursday. The State Department\\'s plan, which was being finalized and could be announced within days, would call for the departure of non-essential staff and diplomats\\' families, the sources said. But it was unclear whether leaving the island would be voluntary or compulsory, and one U.S. official said some details were still being worked out. U.S. officials say 21 U.S. diplomats and family members have been afflicted by health problems of unknown origin, including hearing loss, dizziness and nausea. Several Canadians have also been affected in Cuba, a Canadian official has said. The Cuban government has denied any role and is conducting an investigation. But it has so far said it has been unable to determine the cause. Proposals for a drawdown have moved forward since U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the case, which has been threatening the already fragile detente between the two former Cold War foes. The State Department is expected to stop short of saying it will close the recently reopened embassy because of the mysterious affair, despite Tillerson having said last week that such a move was under consideration. But a partial evacuation, even one depicted by the Trump administration as a safety measure, would also send a message of U.S. displeasure over Cuba\\'s handling of the matter and deliver another blow to Obama-era engagement policies with Havana. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters Thursday that Tillerson â€“ who is now on his way to Beijing - was reviewing all of his options for \"how to best protect our American personnel\" in Cuba and that she was not ready to announce any decision. But congressional staffers were briefed on the plan on Thursday, two congressional sources said. Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a harsh critic of the Cuban government, hinted at the State Department\\'s coming decision. \"Any reduction of Americans from @USEmbassyHavana should also require equal number of Castro employees leaving regime\\'s embassy in U.S.,\" he said in a message on Twitter. The State Department declined comment. McClatchy news service was the first to report this week that the United States would soon begin a major withdrawal of Havana staff. Depending on how many diplomats leave, the Havana embassy â€“ the main point of contact for U.S. citizens visiting the island as well as American companies doing business there â€“ could be left with more of a skeletal staff to handle responsibilities. Though Washington has not cast direct blame on Cuban authorities, the State Department said Tillerson reminded Rodriguez at Tuesday\\'s meeting of Cuba\\'s obligation to protect diplomats and their families. In the highest-level U.S.-Cuba meeting since President Donald Trump took office, Rodriguez warned the United States against taking hasty decisions and urged Washington to cooperate with its ongoing investigation. Washington earlier this year expelled two Cuban diplomats over the alleged incidents. The case has brought simmering tensions between the two countries since Trump took office to the boil. Trump, who in June vowed to partially roll back the detente with Cuba agreed by his Democratic predecessor, President Barack Obama, called the Cuban government \"corrupt and destabilizing\" in his address to the United Nations General Assembly last week. He said he would not lift the U.S. trade embargo on the Caribbean island until it made \"fundamental reforms.\" Cuba described his comments as \"unacceptable and meddling.\"',\n",

              " 'Go to Article Donald Trump was willing to give up a very fulfilling life that took decades to build, so he could step up and take control of an out of control government. He and his family have already sacrificed so much because he chose to put his country first. Making sacrifices is certainly not something loudmouth liberals like Robert DeNiro are accustomed to. DeNiro was very vocal about his opposition to the wildly successful business man Donald J. Trump. He felt so strongly about his hate for Trump that made a video where he angrily stated he\\'d like to, \"punch him in the face.\" Now that Trump won the election in a landslide, DeNiro has chosen to get behind the Trump rioters who are terrorizing cities across America. Anti-Trump rioters are breaking windows, using baseball bats to smash the windshields of innocent citizens who get trapped in their hellish protests as they try to escape. Women who are taking part in the protests are being punched in the faces by men who are also taking part in the George Soros funded protests. American flags are being burned and families who are walking in major cities are being subjected to the most vile and disgusting, hateful language and images imaginable. If this is the kind of America that Robert DiNero is openly supporting? And if so, why would any American pay to see his movie,\"Comedian\"?  Robert De Niro gave anti-Donald Trump protesters across the United States his backing Friday as he spoke about how \"depressed\" the tycoon\\'s win in the presidential election had made him.  The 73-year-old star was on the red carpet at the world premiere of his new film \"The Comedian\" in Los Angeles when he was asked how he was coping with Trump\\'s victory over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.  \"How am I doing? I\\'m very depressed,\" the famously laconic \"Raging Bull\" actor told reporters.  \"We have to just wait and see how things go and keep our eyes ever vigilant on the new government.\"  Asked if he thought the protests were an appropriate response to the outcome of Tuesday\\'s election, he replied: \"Yes, absolutely. Things aren\\'t being done right.\"  Demonstrators took to the streets in Miami, Los Angeles, New York and other US cities for a third straight night on Friday.  In Manhattan, they held signs reading \"Your Wall Can\\'t Stand in Our Way\" â€” a reference to the anti-immigration barrier the billionaire has promised to build on the US border with Mexico.  De Niro hasn\\'t minced his words in his criticism of Trump, describing him as \"a punk,\" \"a pig\" and \"an idiot.\"  \"I\\'d like to punch him in the face,\" he said before the election.  Earlier in the day a town in southern Italy where De Niro\\'s grandparents came from offered the actor a means of escape.  \"If, after the disappointment of Trump, he wants to take refuge here, we are ready to welcome him,\" said Antonio Cerio, the mayor of Ferrazzano.  \"The Comedian,\" De Niro\\'s passion project which took him eight years to bring to the big screen, was part of this year\\'s program for the American Film Institute\\'s annual AFI Fest in Los Angeles. â€“ Yahoo  Here\\'s a clip of Trump-hater Megyn Kelly promoting DiNero\\'s hateful rant against Donald J.

              " 'In 2012, the movie phenomenon \"The Avengers\" filled theaters across the globe. Commercials, product advertisements, and billboards plastered with this ragtag team of superheroes who somehow forge a relationship to help save humanity from certain destruction at the hands of an evil villain was a fan favorite. The Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America, Hawkeye, and Scarlet leaped into action after being convinced by the military genius Mr. Furry. They were able to put aside their differences and work for the greater good. In the end, the world is safe. In the first two weeks, the film raked in over $215 million and instantly confirming the superhero concept of \"The Avengers\" was not so new, in fact, it is sometimes a very common occurrence. During this election season, more than just the presidency is at stake. Although crime, division, malice and wrongdoing seems to be ever-present, instead of wallowing in discouragement voters need to exercise the right to become an avenger in a world of evildoers. After the computer generated images, million dollar budgets and Hollywood star power are stripped away, an Avenger is simply an individual who takes up the cause of another who is unable to protect himself or herself. In different circles, that person may be referred to as an advocate. At the core of humanity, people should make a choice to operate by the infamous Golden Rule, which is \"Treat others the way you want to be treated.\" By the looks of American culture, it seems many have strayed far away from this simple principle. Society has always been balanced by persons stepping up to the plate to champion causes bigger than themselves. These everyday avengers have come in the form of presidents willing to abolish slavery, pilots flying beyond enemy lines, ministers willing to lock arms and protest on behalf of others for equal rights and even voters who go to the polls to make their voice heard. Society has been privileged to experience them come from diverse backgrounds, ethnicities, and cultures all with the same selfless spirit. They may not have worn a cape but were viewed as \"super\" just the same. During this heated election season, voters possess that same heroic power. In the midst of all the confusion screaming across the fabric of today\\'s society, many would love to function as an avenger but are not sure how. Here are a few places modern-day Avengers have the ability to cast a vote in a world of evil and take action: In the area of women\\'s rights It is not uncommon to see the face of a woman plastered on the cover of business magazines as top CEOs and other company leaders. However, in the broader scope of the country, there are still great strides needed to bring equality across genders. In the United States, women still earn dramatically less than their male counterparts do in Corporate America. First Lady Michelle Obama championed equal pay for equal work on the campaign trail and now organizations such as the National Organization for Women remain on the front line of this issue fighting to make sure the progress achieved in the last sixty years is not in vain. Without the vote, progress does not happen. Better education in underserved communities Civil Rights leader and advocate Malcolm X once said, \"Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today.\" This concept has been the foundation for public education in America. The right to receive adequate training to be a productive and prosperous American is the right of every person. Therefore, it is amazing to see certain communities with gross neglect and weak curriculums. These areas lack a voice to speak on their behalf. It is encouraging to see leadership like the Gary Comer College Prep School that shines as a beacon in the Chicago area. Amidst killing and senseless loss of life, this school boasts an excellent attrition rate for high school seniors accepted into college. Better healthcare for all people The country is in the middle of a tug of war. Unfortunately, what is at stake is far greater than bragging rights. The health and welfare of seniors and children hang in the balance of those on Capitol Hill. Whether Obamacare is right or wrong is not as important as the need for dialogue around this issue. On one hand, there are elderly who are struggling with the decision to purchase food or their prescriptions and on the other, there are parents who cannot receive proper care at neighborhood clinics. Parents should not have to wonder if their doctor could afford to keep his doors open when he is the only office in the community. There is an initiative to bring mobile clinics to the heart of areas needing it the most. Armed with immunizations, screening, and dental supplies, they are giving away services free that otherwise would not even happen. The moral of Becoming an Avenger No one promises a cape or a billboard, but everyone has a super ability to step in and relieve the sufferings of others. All it takes to be a real-life Avenger is the choice to fight for the needs of the less fortunate; those without a voice or an advocate. In November do not sit idly by, vote to become an avenger in a world seemingly overtaken by evildoers. Not only does this produce a sense of fulfillment and greatness, it also provides the opportunity to be remembered as a modern-day Avenger. These are only a few of many opportunities for activism, but there are many ways to become an active participant in the goal for change. It may seem small and uneventful, but the vote has a unique power to affect the Oval Office more than Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. For those who have not been privileged to cast an early ballot, pause for the cause and vote, vote, vote on November 8.

              " 'May 7th is likely going to be a day of clashes against protesters who are coming from all over the United States to demonstrate against the removal of Confederate monuments in New Orleans. Homeland Security and New Orleans Police Superintendent Michael Harrison have promised that they will be arresting anyone who commits or threatens to commit an act of violence. The three locations they ll be watching are: Lee Circle, Congo Square and the Jefferson Davis monument, as credible threats have been reportedTension in New Orleans has mounted since the Battle of Liberty Place obelisk was removed early on the morning of April 24, part of an initiative by Mayor Mitch Landrieu, backed by the City Council, to rid New Orleans of what some consider to be tributes to racism. Supporters consider the monuments part of history, and their removal an attempt to erase history.Protestors on both sides clashed at the Jefferson Davis statute this week, prompting police to barricade the monument. Barricades also appeared Friday afternoon at Lee Circle.Landrieu has said statues of Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and P.G.T. Beauregard and Confederacy President Jefferson Davis will come down sometime after the 2017 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival wraps ends Sunday.RADICAL activists like Take Em Down Nola, a group that has long advocated for the monuments removal, plans to rally at Congo Square on Sunday at 1:30 p.m then march to Lee Circle. At least one pro-monument contingent has called for a rally at 11 a.m. at Lee Circle.From the Take Em Down Nola website:TAKE EM DOWN NOLA CALLS FOR PEOPLES CELEBRATION & SECOND LINE TO BURY WHITE SUPREMACYWhile white supremacists gather from many states around confederate monuments in OUR CITY, the mayor nor council has still not publicly called for its own ceremony to honor the historic occasion of 4 monuments to slavery coming down. Even the conservative governor of S.C. had a public ceremony to remove the confederate flag. Cowering in darkness offers no safety or protection, it is shameful and being questioned by world wide media.We the people of New Orleans demand that the Mayor and City Council take immediate action to remove all monuments, school names and street signs dedicated to White Supremacists. These structures litter our city with visual reminders of the horrid legacy of slavery that terrorized so many of this city s ancestors. They misrepresent our community. We demand the freedom to live in a city where we are not forced to pay taxes for the maintenance of public symbols that demean us and psychologically terrorize us. We demand:1.That the city release a timeline for the immediate removal of the monuments; 2.That the city expand the definition from 4 specific monuments to encompass all monuments to White Supremacy 3.That the city develop a community driven process for the removal of the monuments and the choosing of their replacements.Not everyone agrees with Take Em Down Nola that Confederate statues are a sign of racism. One of the most vocal defenders of the Confederate flag and of the Confederate statues in New Orleans is black female conservative activist Arlene Barnum. Barnum is pictured below with her friend, author and popular pro-Confederate flag speaker Anthony Hervey. Barnum was with when she says he was killed by 4-5 black youths after attending a pro-confederate flag rally in Mississippi. According to Barnum, she and Hervey were guest speakers at the rally in Mississippi. As they were leaving the rally, the SUV driven by Hervey was chased down by a silver car with 4-5 young black men inside. During the chase, he lost control of his car, it flipped and he was killed. Apparently his life didn t matter to the black community, as they never uttered a word about his suspicious death:PUBLIC NOTICE.. LISTEN UP very carefully. If anyone of you who claim to be pro-Confederate, but who are anti-Confederate Battle flag, then REMOVE yourself from my friends list. And be quick about it.If you are against the displaying of the Confederate Battle Flag in public, then REMOVE yourself from my friends list. Do it now!If you are advocating that people NOT bring Confederate Battle Flag into New Orleans at the endangered Confederate monuments, then REMOVE yourself from my friends list. And be quick as lickity split!As far as I know, I don t have any BLM folks on my friends list. And when I catch em thru the cracks, I remove & block them with the most extreme prejudice. However, in the case of these self-professed pro Confederate folks who have issues with that battle flag emblem, I will give them the respect, dignity & the curtesy to REMOVE themselves. I m giving them 72 hrs.In photo, the man to the left, Anthony Hervey is a Mississippian who was not afraid to publicly display the Confederate battle flag. As a colored man, he has been vilified, attacked, physically assaulted, called all sorts of racial insults that not even the average white Confederate flaggers had endured. But yet he kept on flagging proudly until the day he was killed. So don t give me that sh*t excuse to justify hiding the Confederate Battle flag to avoid being called a racist. I guarantee you that EVERY colored Confederate flagger I know have been called much worse & treated with violence & are the 1st to be targeted at public venues.You better not be black and support free speech or a Confederate monument in America or expect to be threatened by the left. This is no joke. Facebook user Gene Black threatened a black Confederate statue supporter s family while he s in New Orleans on his wall 4 days ago:Much like ISIS, pro-Confederate monument removal groups like Take Em Down Nola and communist groups like Antifa plan to come together to threaten free speech and freedom of expression.Black Rebel posted this image with the following message: words cannot described the friendships built after fighting side by side. on his Facebook page: Black Rebel also posted this video of an anti-free speech leftist launching a glass bottle, just missing the head of a fellow pro-confederate monument protester. Watch how the police take their time walking over to the area from where the bottle was thrown. You can hear the free speech protesters yelling, Do something! to the police officers as they appear to be in no hurry to do anything about it. Let s hope this is not an example of how police plan to respond to any potential acts of violence today, or things are likely to get very ugly very quickly: New Orleans Police Department held a press conference on Saturday where they made the public aware they are planning to keep the citizens of New Orleans safe and will keep the protesters safe from violence and from the threat of violence. Police Chief Harrison also makes it clear that they will take swift action for anyone who violates the law. Chief Harrison also makes clear that while they respect the rights of citizens to open carry weapons in New Orleans, that those weapons are not allowed at a public protest:Watch the response from American Warrior Revolution member to New Orleans Police Chief Harrison s press conference:',\n",
              " 'Punto Negro â€“Punto BlancoÂ© May 18, 2016 Yes, Trumpet was right Megyn Kelly is a Bimbo According to an online definition a Bimbo is an attractive but empty-headed young woman, especially one perceived as a willing sex object in other words a slut. If you need help with that definition, you need to stop reading and go back to school. So how did I reach the conclusion you may ask? During the Trumpet run for clown president in January, he wrote: Donald J. Trump âœ”\\u200e@realDonaldTrump \"@gene70: @FireFlyFury @megynkelly @realDonaldTrump And this is the bimbo that\\'s asking presidential questions?pic.twitter.com/oU1uUGnuWb\" 3:36 AM - 28 Jan 2016 Now let\\'s get this straight he called a whore, a slut or as we in the HI Spanic, community would say a puta. (See google on line). I don\\'t know if the woman is married, but if somebody called my wife a bimbo and retweeted it 423 times, he would be looking up from the floor. Being nonviolent a person as I am that is, I am just saying. Women all over America were upset by this degrading term on national media. It is a term that is unacceptable in the workplace and could get an employee fired for using it at work. I know I taught Sexual Harassment classes to over ten thousand public employees. The term is right up there with skank. Men and women alike applauded Kelly for her firm stand against Trump and she was to moderate more of the Fascist News Network debates. Then Trumpet announced that if she was moderating he would not attend. Fox concerned about its ratings and the loss of revenue sat Kelly down and told her to fix this. (See bimbo above network.) She and Trumpet had a one hour private meeting. Want to guess what he told her in that meeting? Note it was her responsibility as the victim to show that it was ok. How did that happen, in case you missed it Kelly did a one on one televised interview, (no pun intended) with Trumpet? The Guardian reported \"He also sought to downplay his embrace of the phrase \"bimbo\" to describe Kelly, suggesting at first that he didn\\'t recall doing so. When Kelly pointed out Trump had on several occasions retweeted followers insulting her as such, he responded: \"Ooo. OK. Did I say that? Excuse me.\" He added: \"Over your life, Megyn, you\\'ve been called a lot worse. It\\'s a modern form of fighting back.\" Kelly said that it was not about her but rather about the message sent to young girls, to which Trump only offered that he would no longer go after her \"because I think I like our relationship right now\". In other words now that you are being a good Fox bimbo and will do what you are told I can talk to you. Note he never said I am sorry, I apologize for calling you a slut. He just said \"Oh did I say that?\" If that was the apology in my world, he would be looking up from the floor. (I am just saying.) Men like him would never work in California state government or private industry unless someone liked paying millions of dollars in court costs and damages. In California, the status of women in the workplace is not the ultimate best but it is getting better. Kelly has proved that she is no model for working women. She is the worst example to our young women who strive to succeed as professionals. Trumpet is a racist sexist thug that is the bottom line. What is to be done? First, Americans have to decide if having a Thug in the white house is a good thing or a bad thing. If they don\\'t care and most of the replicants with few exception are lining up to jump over the cliff. Moreover, republicant voters who vote will vote 95% for the Trumpet that is the hard statiscal fact, simply because they hate the Clintons. Second, the Clintons have to get off their respective culos and start physically campaigning in Latino neighborhoods and spend 50 million dollars on Latino vote by mail and gotv campaigns. Hillary needs real Latino professionals working her campaign. Hillary should also apologize to the women and men of America for Megan Kelly and her lack moral fiber. Then America could take her seriously. She will then be the nominee of the thinking people of America.

              " 'Anyone inclined to find joy when a president\\'s taste collides with yours had a lot to choose from with Barack Obama. There was the time he dropped by the Los Angeles garage where the comedian Marc Maron records his podcast or when he sat between the two ferns where Zach Galifianakis pretends to be a boob hosting a talk show. At the 2015 White House Correspondents\\' Association Dinner, he did a bit with Key as Luther, Mr. Obama\\'s fictional but legitimately irate \"anger translator\" from \"Key Peele. \" He called Kanye West a jackass, invited Miranda to the White House Poetry Jam to perform a song from \"Hamilton\" before \"Hamilton\" was even a thing, and, for two straight years, dropped thoroughly convincing Spotify playlists. That doesn\\'t even include the New York Review of Books conversation (in two parts!) between him and the novelist Marilynne Robinson. They talked about â€¦ about â€¦ well it\\'s just sobering and oracular, and you should read it. But of all the culture Barack Obama has been a part of, inspired, commented on or cultivated, of all the ways in which the culture seemed to evolve around â€” and unconsciously respond to â€” him, the thing that says so much about his unprecedented relationship to art and popular culture is actually, in the vast scheme of things, just a footnote. Which is to say it\\'s pretty small yet so illustrative of his sense of respect, professionalism and awe. It was the time he was emailed for a quote. The occasion was the 2015 Kennedy Center Honors. The inductees included Carole King, who sat in the balcony between her fellow inductee George Lucas and the first couple. And during Ms. King\\'s tribute, out came Aretha Franklin, who sat at a piano in a fur coat and sang \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,\" the classic Ms. King wrote, and Ms. Franklin released in 1967. Her appearance was pretty much expected. The shock was how powerfully good, at 73, Ms. Franklin sounded â€” so good that you worried ecstasy would send Ms. King toppling off the balcony, so good that Mr. Obama wiped tears from his eyes. For a critical profile of Ms. Franklin in The New Yorker, its editor, David Remnick, reached out to the president. As a critic, I feel a duty to point out that that\\'s an unusual move. Mr. Remnick is also, among other things, a critic. He knows Ms. Franklin\\'s worth as an American treasure and that it has no price. He\\'s more than equipped to sum her up. But he outsourced that job. To the president of the United States. And if you got to that section of that story and considered rolling your eyes (\"When I emailed President Obama about Aretha Franklin and that night â€¦ \") you immediately retreated when you read what Mr. Obama wrote in response. \"Nobody embodies more fully the connection between the spiritual, the blues, R. B. rock and roll â€” the way that hardship and sorrow were transformed into something full of beauty and vitality and hope,\" he wrote back, through his press secretary. \"American history wells up when Aretha sings. That\\'s why, when she sits down at a piano and sings \\'A Natural Woman,\\' she can move me to tears â€” the same way that Ray Charles\\'s version of \\'America the Beautiful\\' will always be in my view the most patriotic piece of music ever performed â€” because it captures the fullness of the American experience, the view from the bottom as well as the top, the good and the bad, and the possibility of synthesis, reconciliation, transcendence. \" Mr. Remnick wrote to him because he knew that Barack Obama would deliver. Mr. Remnick asked for two cents. The president gave him a dollar. Mr. Obama, for nearly all of his tenure, was fully aware of, interested in, and knowledgeable about popular culture, even as it grew impossible to take it all in. He tried: sports, movies, television, the internet, music, books. He was protean and catholic. He was thoughtful and cool and yet far from it. He was a version of America\\'s dad and the dad some kids wished theirs could be: fit for world leadership, fit for a sitcom. Lots of smart people are poring over Mr. Obama\\'s record to divine a legacy. Which policies will last? How did he change the job? How did he distinguish himself? But this was a presidency whose few faint whiffs of scandal included being surreptitiously videoed last year by Usher dancing listlessly to Drake\\'s \"Hotline Bling,\" which was more than a year old. So to be fair: It\\'s an addictive song, and he moved like someone who had been dancing to it since it came out. In other words, Mr. Obama\\'s place in popular culture has always felt new, alive and mostly underappreciated. Obviously, other presidents have had a relationship with American culture. Television was in its creative infancy when Dwight D. Eisenhower entered office in 1953, and he took quick advantage of the power of its immediacy. When John F. Kennedy turned 45, he received American history\\'s most famous \"Happy Birthday\" from Marilyn Monroe. But it was tragedy and a glamorous wife that ensured Kennedy\\'s legacy in popular culture. Richard Nixon disliked \"All in the Family\" and was an avid moviegoer, who according to Mark Feeney\\'s surprising book \"Nixon at the Movies,\" watched about 500 films during his presidency. Ronald Reagan was a Hollywood actor before he was a politician, and, as a candidate, Bill Clinton made a lot of sense on MTV and Arsenio Hall\\'s talk show. But has any president been as conversant in the art and popular culture of this country as Barack Obama? Who has been as committed to opening up the White House to the sorts of artists he has? Lunches with the novelists Zadie Smith, Barbara Kingsolver, Junot DÃ­az, Dave Eggers and Colson Whitehead. One lunch, actually. That was one lunch. Initiative summits that included Alicia Keys, Nicki Minaj, J. Cole, Ludacris, Rick Ross, Pusha T. Common and Chance the Rapper. (So many different rappers and RB singers have come through the White House in the last eight years that the BET Awards could sue for copyright infringement.) Last year, Barack and Michelle Obama hosted \"Jazz at the White House,\" which featured appearances by so many magnificent, important people that to type out all the names â€” Chick Corea, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Ms. Franklin, for openers â€” is to make a very fancy shopping list. Mr. Obama brought all kinds of art and culture into the White House, and he sought culture out. At the same time, how we experience that art and culture, changed as much as the culture itself. When he entered office, in 2009, Netflix was a service. Now it\\'s a major reason we no longer watch TV we scarf it down. But that disruption â€” from channels and networks to platforms and apps â€” also unleashed TV that looked more like America: more nonwhite characters, more women, more gays. He presided over an era in which television and movies grappled with the meaning and meaninglessness of race, whether to laugh at it or take it seriously or ignore it altogether, whether the idea of a postracial America was ever possible, as though electing a black man for eight years erases the traumas of 400. To that end, \"30 Rock\" was the great situation comedy â€” a workplace farce, on and loosely about NBC, that hit its stride in 2008 and ran until 2013. Not so secretly, it was about the insurmountable work of race and gender. Meanwhile, the American movie industry went all in on franchises and sequels while leaving art and humanity for TV. But the \"Fast and Furious\" movies did bounce off the assembly line. The series started in 2001, essentially died in 2003, and came roaring back to life at the start of Mr. Obama\\'s first term and is ludicrously yet thankfully on the verge of an eighth installment. The protagonists are car thieves turned action heroes, who are mostly black, Asian, Latina or racially ambiguous. These aren\\'t great movies. But they\\'re great, fun: serious and without too much (or any) . And they take an issue that Hollywood has always struggled with â€” what to do with all these talented, interesting people of color? â€” and laughs at it. What to do? It\\'s not that hard: Let \\'em drive. Mr. Obama had his priorities straight, of course. Pop culture and art aren\\'t aspects of American life that should dominate a presidency. They have little to do with the business of governance. But Mr. Obama has always seemed to understand the importance of culture as mirror, window, escape hatch and haven. The Obamas were catholic in their tastes not because they had to be, but because that\\'s what we should be: open. Their minds were open, their hearts were open, their arms were open â€” to the Willie Nelsons, the BeyoncÃ©s, the Junot DÃ­azes, to all kinds of excellence. One of the happiest cultural events I\\'ve ever watched was the Presidential Medal of Freedom ceremony in November. The honor went to 21 men and women, from Robert De Niro and Tom Hanks and Michael Jordan to Cicely Tyson and Diana Ross and Ellen DeGeneres. Bill and Melinda Gates were honored. So were Maya Lin and Robert Redford. Mr. Obama had good material for most of them â€” philanthropists, movies stars, architect, alike. And, as he so often does and gets nary enough credit for, he delivered it with perfectly timed drollery. (He could easily enjoy a second career as a comedian.) These people meant something to him. His joshing notwithstanding, a few of them appeared to mean everything. The knock on Mr. Obama was that he was dry and aloof. Perhaps but not always. He understood what laughter could do. He knew the power of songs. He knew the power of singers, even if the only person doing the singing was, at first, only him. In 2015, at the memorial service after the Charleston massacre, he takes a dramatic, deliberative pause before intoning the lyrics to \"Amazing Grace. \" He starts and the choir behind him rises, out of surprise. You can tell he\\'s not singing because he thinks his baritone sounds good. He\\'s singing because something\\'s come over him, the way it does me, the way it does lots of people. What appears to have come over him at that memorial is both a sincere holiness and a rare, powerfully particular recognition of the glory and tragic risk of being black and American: He had to sing. In that moment, that song was all he seemed to have. That\\'s not a sensation you go looking for. It finds you. Good historians tend to know the right moment to evaluate a president\\'s place. They wait until the office is behind him, for the right mix of distance and scholarship. In the meantime, Barack Obama\\'s performance as president â€” meaning the performance he gave in the role of president of the United States â€” was flawless. Culturally speaking, he didn\\'t use his office to lift up, enlighten and entertain so much as share it. He wrote to David Remnick that he loved Ray Charles\\'s version of \"America the Beautiful\" because \"it captures the fullness of the American experience, the view from the bottom as well as the top, the good and the bad, and the possibility of synthesis, reconciliation, transcendence. \" The man knows his country and his Ray. But it\\'s entirely possible to read that quote and catch a chill because Mr. Obama could easily have been writing about himself.',\n",
              " 'Paul Ryan and the Republican leadership are rolling out plans to keep wages stagnant in America for the foreseeable future. A $23 billion cut is aimed at eliminating food benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to people on unemployment who are either in school or job training. It s an age-old GOP tactic. Eliminate the help for people who are looking to do better and they are forced out of school or training and into minimum wage jobs.Once they get there, the Republicans can claim they re teenagers living at home for free and it s their own fault for settling for a minimum wage job when all they have to do is go back to school or get some training. And the cycle continues. According to Roll Call:Republican leaders have proposed more than $23 billion in food stamp cuts in a budget plan that could be brought to the House floor in the next two weeks, several sources say.The proposed changes in the food stamp, or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, include the end of waivers that allow some adults to receive assistance for a limited amount of time, while they are in school, or training for a job.$23 billion in cuts to food for people. Is there nowhere else we could look for $23 billion dollars? How over budget is that fighter jet program again? We re not talking about handing people cash outside a liquor store here; we re talking about food. All the BS about fraud and dependence and still one in four children in this country struggle with food. Republicans have been after the food stamp program for no reason other than to keep people as desperate as possible.Just imagine if Donald Trump is elected with a Republican majority in Congress. Food will be distributed to the poor in the streets in the form of bags of flour and rice and maybe some milk and whey to make cheese. OK, maybe that s a little extreme. There won t be any free food. Certainly in a Trumptopian society, the poor will stay out of sight where they belong.Featured image from foodsecuritychallenge.com',\n",
              " 'I really, really want to give the Lego Falcon a five star rating. It is by far my favorite ship in all the Star Wars movies, and the Lego model is a near perfect representation of the ship. Also this was the first big Star Wars Lego set I bought, which in turn brought forth a wonderful second childhood of building the toys I dreamt of as a kid. I\\'ve since purchased six other models including the mighty Death Star. It really deserves the highest rating, but personal feelings aside, I can\\'t. Why? Because once constructed, the model is very flimsy. I\\'ve read other reviews that bragged about how sturdy it was, and I don\\'t see it. Every time I move it around, I have to be very careful. The side hedges snap out of place quite often and have to be reattached, and the ceiling panels can come off very easily. At one point, the entire cockpit assembly came apart and I had to dig out the instruction booklet to make sure it was properly attached. Honestly, I think this is a really awesome model, but it just doesn\\'t seem sturdy enough for the rough play kids will do with it once built. Okay, now that I said that I can get on to the good stuff. This is really a fun ship to build, and it will take a while. I spent four afternoons working on it, but that\\'s mostly because I like taking my time putting these things together. I suppose an expert builder with the time could put it together in one afternoon. Also, as with the Lego Death Star, which I also reviewed, the detail is amazing, and every single thing featured in the movies is here, from the holographic chess table to Luke\\'s Jedi training ball (even though it\\'s on the opposite side of the ship). The Luke figure even has a reversible face with the blast shield so he can put on the helmet and train. The tiny details like that are the things that always amaze me about these Lego sets. The inside of the ship is very spacious. You could literally fit a small army of mini-figs inside. I can\\'t help but think the Lego people could have done even more with the inside, but like I said, they already included everything you could think of. Also the mini-fig selection is awesome. You get all the main characters in their classic \"New Hope\" outfits. Though I find the inclusion of Darth Vader a bit odd since he never set foot on the Falcon. I would have liked to see Lando instead, since it was originally his ship and he later piloted it in Han\\'s absence. They could have even put him in his generals outfit from ROTJ, but it\\'s seems as if the Lego people wanted to stick to the characters from ANH. A couple minor complaints before I conclude. As other reviewers have noted, the cockpit is small. With all the room inside the main body of the ship, I think they could have done more here. Same with the gun turret seats in the center of the ship. It\\'s really just a flat panel with some controls attached and can\\'t be accessed from the interior of the ship. It seems more like an after thought. Overall, I hope no one lets my earlier criticism bother them too much. It really is an awesome ship, but I just find it a bit difficult to keep together, and I think that should be noted. In spite of a few flaws, it\\'s still very much worth it.',\n",

              " 'Food Stamp use has miraculously gone down in several states! It s a miracle! In 13 Alabama counties, food stamp use went down a whopping 85%!When Obama took out the welfare-to-work requirement, the use of food stamps skyrocketed to nearly 45 million Americans! That s 1 in every 7 US citizens using food stamps! Now that the Trump administration has vowed to reduce the use, it s interesting to see that people jump off of assistance when the work requirement is put back in.Georgia and Alabama have seen a sharp decrease in food stamp use with the work requirement back in:Georgia:More than half of the 11,779 people enrolled for food stamps in 21 counties, an estimated 7,251 people, have dropped out of the food stamp program a drop of 62 percent, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.Georgia first rolled out its work requirements for the food stamp program in three counties in January 2016. Since then, the state has expanded work requirements in an additional 21 counties, giving people in those 21 counties until April 1, 2017 to find a job or lose food stamp benefits. Via: BNALABAMA:Thirteen previously exempted Alabama counties saw an 85 percent drop in food stamp participation after work requirements were put in place on Jan. 1, according to the Alabama Department of Human Resources.The counties Greene, Hale, Perry, Dallas, Lowndes, Wilcox, Monroe, Conecuh, Clarke, Washington, Choctaw, Sumter and Barbour had been exempt from a change that limited able-bodied adults without dependents to three months of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits within a three-year time frame unless they were working or participating in an approved training program.During the economic downturn of 2011-2013, several states including Alabama waived the SNAP work requirements in response to high unemployment. It was reinstituted for 54 counties on Jan. 1, 2016 and for the remaining 13 on Jan. 1, 2017. As of April 2017, the highest jobless rate among the 13 previously excluded counties was in Wilcox County, which reported a state-high unemployment rate of 11.7 percent, down more than 11 percentage points from the county s jobless rate for the same month of 2011.Ending the exemption has dramatically cut the number of SNAP recipients in the counties.As of Jan. 1, 2017, there were 13,663 able-bodied adults without dependents receiving food stamps statewide. That number dropped to 7,483 by May 1, 2017. Among the 13 counties, there were 5,538 adults ages 18-50 without dependents receiving food stamps as of Jan. 1, 2017. That number dropped to 831 a decline of about 85 percent by May 1, 2017. Based on the trend, the number of (able-bodied adults without dependents) recipients for SNAP benefits is expected to continue to decline statewide and in the formerly 13 exempted counties, according to Alabama DHR spokesperson John Hardy.Statewide, the number of able-bodied adults receiving food stamps has fallen by almost 35,000 people since Jan. 1, 2016. Each recipient receives about $126 a month in benefits.Nationwide, there are about 44 million people receiving SNAP benefits at a cost of about $71 billion. The Trump administration has vowed to cut the food stamp rolls over the next decade, including ensuring that able-bodied adults recipients are working.',\n",
              " 'First published October 31, 2016  Iraq is going to invade and destroy Saudi Arabia. They would have done it back in 1990 except for waffling by George H.W. Bush who had initially authorized the move and then rescinded approval, according to statements made by former Congressman Ron Paul, based on WikiLeaks State Department hacks.  Saddam was blocked in 1990, and that may well have been a huge mistake on the part of everyone involved. When the US returned in 2003, it was Saudi cash that financed the Sunni Wahhabist was against the coalition government in Baghdad, a war that continues to this day, with the same cast of characters, the same Saudi cash, but they now call it \"ISIS.\"  5000 Americans died fighting Saudi paid jihadists.  Saudi Arabia has always known that Iraq has only allowed them to continue their mischief so long as they served a purpose. When the war with Iran ended in 1988, that purpose had ended also.  Saudi mischief in Iraq, playing tribe against tribe, pushing for Kurdish separatism and partnering with Israeli intelligence, ramped up as America scaled back her military presence under President Obama.  By 2014, a logistics and command structure to destroy both Syria and Iraq had been established, headquartered in the Saudi embassies in Beirut and Amman and operating military operations centers, designed and built by the Israelis, at key locations in Turkey and quickly bolstered by satellite facilities across Iraq and Syria. The Saudi\\'s were feeling time getting away from them, their decades of military buildup, based on endless oil and investment performance, no long sustainable. They had to knock out Syria and Iraq, using Israel, Turkey and NATO as surrogates, push the US into destroying Iran and cleanse Yemen of threats.  They bribed everyone they got near. Were the Saudi\\'s really the ones behind the Arab spring? Do we see the hands of Saudi Arabia when Israel channels Hamas fighters into the Yarmouk Camp, outside Damascus, to bolster ISIS forces? These are the telling events few see, but that prove the hypothesis and provide what is needed to predict a future that may well no longer include the Dark Kingdom.  With a world obsessed with Islamic extremism and terror threats, why is no one looking at where it comes from, who finances, whose ideas are behind it and who it serves? With fingers pointing at the Mossad or CIA and so many others, the real issue is Wahhabism and the real root of it all is Saudi Arabia.  There is no version of 9/11 that doesn\\'t credit Saudi Mohammed Atta as planner of 9/11, whether assisted by Israeli art students or Osama bin Laden, depending on which theories you follow. The Saudi\\'s did it and American civil courts are busy now assessing the damages.  Oil money and sovereign immunity and, oh yes, control of the UN Human Rights Council, from which Russia was just expelled, protect them also, despite their abuses and love of head chopping. Pro-Iran militias in Iraq  What is playing out now will lead only one direction , to a stronger Iraq, one under Shiite control with the economically powerful Sunni families, quietly migrating to their second homes in Dubai and Qatar.  The crippled military the US saddled Iraq with will be gone, replaced by powerful Iranian-trained militias.  The American-trained army joined ISIS. Had Prime Minister Maliki, back in 2014, been more aware of the threat, he would have moved against the Army. That, however, would have renewed the civil war, a war that could only have been ended with Iranian military intervention and Iran was still reeling with sanctions and the threat of American invasion.  That threat is gone also. That world is gone, or soon will be as is being played out in Mosul and Aleppo. No one would have imagined Baghdad\\'s resolve or the partnership between Russia and Iran. Still in question is Turkey\\'s role. It is clear someone promised them Aleppo and Mosul, as is reflected in their military incursions into Syria and Iraq.  If Saudi Arabia thinks Turkey will lift a hand to block Iraq\\'s wrath, they are delusional. Turkey knows it can have peace with Iran and that both share similar ideas about the Kurds. This far outweighs any Turkish ambitions to the South. Turkey may well be planning a new Ottoman Empire, but Saudi Arabia is not in the cards for Turkish occupation. Members of the Abbas combat squad, a Shia militia, trained with Iraqi soldiers in Basra  This leaves the protection of the United States and the upcoming election. Is there any American political leader that would oppose Iraq were they to hit Saudi Arabia, by 2020 or 2021?  The prediction is that Iraq will come out of this war intact and, if they do, with a victorious army for the first time genuinely answerable to Baghdad and reeling from the battle of Mosul, likely to leave 20,000 civilians dead in its wake or more, the national enmity for Saudi Arabia will know no bounds.  The Sunni gangsters from Anbar that aligned with the Saudis are mostly dead, many beheaded by ISIS. The promised Kurdish state in Erbil, the so-called \"Barzani Sultanate\" will not be handed control of the massive Kirkuk oil fields and the Ceyhan Pipeline by ISIS, as may well have been planned.  Without these assets, Erbil will still enjoy a strong commercial presence but will never be able to reach into the Kurdish diaspora and bring the millions home and under questionable rule, subject to Erbil\\'s deal making with everyone. Eventually Erbil will become a ghost town, the sons that returned will again migrate and Turkish ambitions, seemingly undone, will be fulfilled.  As it appears now, Iraq will survive. Iraq also knows that what Saudi Arabia tried twice, they will try again and that the only way Iraq can be free is if Saudi Arabia falls.  And then there is Iran. Iranian aircraft have carried out strikes against the Islamic State.

              " 'President Barack Obama and the deputy crown prince of Saudi Arabia on Friday discussed ways to support Iraqis in their fight against Islamic State militants and the importance of a political transition in war-torn Syria, the White House said. Obama met with Mohammed bin Salman in the Oval office for about an hour. The deputy crown prince is visiting the United States to repair frayed relations and to promote a plan, known as Vision 2030, to slash the kingdom\\'s dependence on oil exports. \"The President expressed appreciation for Saudi Arabia\\'s contributions to the campaign against ISIL,\" the White House said, using an acronym for the Islamic State group. The two talked about steps to support Iraqis \"including increased Gulf support to fund urgent humanitarian and stabilization needs,\" the White House said. U.S. officials have expressed unease about the Saudi-led campaign against Houthi rebels in Yemen, which according to the United Nations and human rights groups has resulted in large numbers of civilian casualties. Saudi Arabia is worried about closer relations between the United States and Iran, Riyadh\\'s arch enemy, after a 2015 nuclear deal. Obama welcomed Saudi Arabia\\'s commitment to a political settlement of the Yemen conflict and support by the Gulf Cooperation Council, of which the kingdom is a member, to address humanitarian needs and rebuild the country, the White House said. On Syria, Obama and the prince talked about the importance of supporting a political transition away from President Bashar al-Assad, the White House said. The United States is working with international partners on what it calls a Syrian-led transition process facilitated by the United Nations, but so far there has been little progress. Over 50 diplomats at the U.S. State Department signed a memo, leaked on Thursday, that was critical of the Obama administration\\'s Syria policy and called for targeted military strikes against Assad\\'s government. Asked about the memo, Saudi Arabia\\'s Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, also in Washington, told reporters the kingdom had been arguing for a \"more robust intervention\" including airstrikes, a no-fly zone, and a no-drive zone, from the beginning of the five-year civil war. Obama does not see a military solution to the crisis in Syria, White House spokeswoman Jen Friedman said. Both Washington and Riyadh are anticipating the release of classified pages of a U.S. report into the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, that some U.S. lawmakers have alleged link Saudi government officials to the attacks. Jubeir said investigations show that the allegations \"are not correct and they don\\'t hold.\"',\n",

              " 'A dam in Puerto Rico weakened by heavy rains from Hurricane Maria was in danger of failing on Sunday, posing a flood threat to thousands of homes downstream as the storm-battered U.S. island territory struggled through a fifth day with virtually no electricity. Some 70,000 people who inhabit a river valley below the Guajataca Dam in the northwestern corner of the island have been under evacuation orders since Friday afternoon, when authorities first warned that the earthen structure was in danger of imminent collapse. The fear of a potentially catastrophic dam break added to the pandemonium facing disaster relief authorities in the aftermath of Maria, which has claimed at least 29 lives across the Caribbean, according to officials and media reports. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello personally urged residents of the area to heed evacuation orders after surveying damage to the dam on Saturday, telling reporters that a fissure in the structure has become a significant rupture. The dam, which stands about 120 feet (37 meters) tall, was built in 1929 and supplies the surrounding region with hydropower, drinking water and irrigation supplies. The National Weather Service in San Juan, the island s capital, extended a flash flood watch for communities along the rain-swollen Guajataca River below the dam through midday Sunday. If the dam were to fail, flooding would be life-threatening, the Weather Service warned. Stay away or be swept away, it said. Maria, the second major hurricane to savage the Caribbean this month and the most powerful to strike Puerto Rico in nearly a century, carved a path of destruction through the island after plowing ashore early on Wednesday. Arriving as a Category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson wind scale, with top winds of up to 155 mph (249.5 kph), Maria ripped roofs from buildings, turned roads into gushing debris-strewn rivers and knocked out power across the entire island, home to 3.4 million people. We lost our house, it was completely flooded, said resident Carmen Gloria Lamb, a resident near the rain-swollen Guajataca. We lost everything; cars, clothes, everything. Puerto Rico officials have officially confirmed 10 storm-related fatalities on the island, and the hurricane was blamed for at least 19 other deaths across the Caribbean, the bulk of them on the devastated island nation of Dominica. Severe flooding, structural damage to homes and the loss of all electricity, except from backup generators, were three of the most pressing problems facing Puerto Ricans, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose state is home to many of Puerto Rican descent, said during a tour of the island. It s a terrible immediate situation that requires assistance from the federal government, not just financial assistance, he said on CNN on Saturday. Even the island s medical facilities have been left in precarious shape, with many hospitals flooded, strewn with rubble and running critically low on diesel fuel needed to keep generators operating. Evacuation to the U.S. mainland is the only option for some patients. Signs of the strain on Puerto Ricans were evident throughout San Juan, the capital. Drivers had to wait up to seven hours at the few filling stations open on Saturday, according to news reports. Water rationing also began on Saturday. Signs posted throughout San Juan s Old Town informed residents that service would return for two hours until further notice. Telephone service also was unreliable, with many of the island s cell towers damaged or destroyed. On Sunday morning, the governor told reporters that officials would continue to clear roads and bridges blocked by the storm and that he would be joining a supply delivery mission to Caguas, a small city in the mountains south of San Juan. The storm caused an estimated $45 billion of damage and lost economic activity across the Caribbean, with at least $30 billion of that in Puerto Rico, said Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler at Enki Research in Savannah, Georgia. Maria, which was hundreds of miles (km) east of Florida over the Atlantic Ocean on Sunday, has been downgraded to a Category 2 storm and was expected to weaken further as it moves north in the Atlantic off the East Coast over the next two days. Maria hit Puerto Rico about two weeks after Hurricane Irma, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms on record, killed more than 80 people in the Caribbean and the United States. The two storms followed Hurricane Harvey, which also killed more than 80 people when it struck Texas in late August and caused flooding in Houston.',\n",

              " 'Print  The deliberations of the Constitutional Convention of 1787 were held in strict secrecy. Citizens gathered outside Independence Hall in Philadelphia during the proceedings, attempting to learn what sort of government had been agreed upon behind closed doors. As he exited the Hall, a woman asked Benjamin Franklin, \"Well, Doctor, what have we got a republic or a monarchy?\"  Franklin responded, \"A republic, if you can keep it.\"  It\\'s important to note that Franklin did not include the word democracy because the difference between a republic and a democracy is fundamental. The word republic comes from the Romans\\' word in Latin res publica â€” which means \"the public thing.\" \"Democracy,\" on the other hand, invented by the Greeks, comes from their words demos and kratein , which means \"the peoples\\' rule.\" Greek democracy meant majority rule. Yet, even during its first few decades of existence, the great Greek thinkers such as Plato and Aristotle rejected democracy as a bad form of governance, labeling it \"mob rule.\"  So we can confer on Franklin\\'s response to that inquiring woman that he believed, in the wake of Britain\\'s capitulation to Washington\\'s revolutionary army, the Continental Congress had created a constitutional republic fashioned much more closely to the Roman representative Republic than the Athenian Democracy.  But now, 230 years later, we must countenance the specter of a woman who has trafficked in national security secrets and is guilty of numerous felonies becoming the president of the United States. This has made me wondering if it might not be possible for the House of Representatives to begin impeachment proceedings against a President Clinton shortly after her election. So I resolved to contact various members of Congress to ask them if they wouldn\\'t attempt impeachment as a means to fulfill their oaths of office to preserve and protect the constitution.  I first made contact with Congressman Tom McClintock of the 4 th District of Northern California. What follows is our interview:  Kelley: Do you agree with my contention that a Hillary presidency would mean that we would be a post constitutional republic?  McClintock: I\\'m afraid we may already have entered the post-constitutional phase of American history. The fundamental architecture of the American Republic â€“ the separation of powers and the Bill of Rights â€“ is already breaking down. The question now is whether we will enter the restoration period or the decline period of our free government. I think a Hillary Clinton presidency has the potential of taking us past a tipping point that makes restoration of the Constitution much more difficult and unlikely.  K: What do you think the ramifications of her election would be?  If the current justices all serve until their actuarial age, the next President will make four appointments to the Supreme Court. Clinton and Justice Ginsburg have made it very clear that once a lock-step leftist majority is cemented into that court, their first two objectives are reversing Citizens United and Heller, which would have dire implications to our First and Second Amendment rights. I would expect that due process protections will begin falling quickly thereafter to enable, among other things, the prosecution of dissenters from leftist global warming orthodoxy. And even if the election of 2020 produced a Republican president with overwhelming Republican congressional majorities, any serious reform legislation could be expected to be struck down by a court whose majority will view its role as policy-making rather than upholding the Constitution. I could add the catastrophic impact of her \"open borders\" program that has devastated Europe and her intention to further increase taxes and regulatory burdens that could deal a knock-out blow to our faltering economy.  K: What do you think the likelihood would be of her immediate impeachment?  M: Zero. Impeachment requires 2/3 of the Senate, which would be a political impossibility.  K: If it cannot remove a known felonious president who, as Secretary of State, compromised national security, has Congress lost its power to be a check on the executive branch?  M: The Constitution was written to be self-enforcing. But that only works as long as its powers are evenly divided; which, in turn, only works if the officials who exercise its powers are obedient to that Constitution; which, in turn, only works if \"we, the people,\" through our votes, insist on it. When we stop insisting on it, we forfeit our Constitution and the freedoms it protects. Lincoln was right: \"If destruction be our lot, we must, ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of free men, we are destined to live for all time, or die by suicide.\"  K: But even if there were no chance she could be removed, wouldn\\'t simply the filing of impeachment articles be a historic way for those who wish to remain obedient to the Constitution to voice a powerful rejection of her lawlessness?  M: Larry, you\\'re dreaming. There\\'s no do-over for this election. (End of Interview).  As a nation, we\\'ve had a pretty good two-hundred-year run. But as Ben Franklin warned and Congressman McClintock fears, we may now have not kept or constitutional republic.  Article reposted with permission from LarryKelley.com shares',\n",

              " 'Chinese state media on Monday continued to play down the protocol-bending phone call last week between U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Taiwan\\'s president, with editorials in two newspapers saying the move showed Trump\\'s inexperience. China\\'s national English-language newspaper, the China Daily, said the 10-minute call \"exposed nothing but the inexperience Trump and his transition team have in dealing with foreign affairs\". \"The action was due to a lack of a proper understanding of the sensitive issues in Sino-U.S. relations and cross-Strait ties,\" it said. The Friday call was the first by a U.S. president-elect or president since President Jimmy Carter switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979, acknowledging Taiwan as part of \"one China\". China\\'s Foreign Ministry said on Saturday it had lodged \"stern representations\" with what it called the \"relevant U.S. side,\" urging the careful handling of the Taiwan issue to avoid any unnecessary disturbances in ties. China considers Taiwan a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday pointedly blamed Taiwan for the exchange, rather than Trump, calling it \"a petty action\". The China Daily said that for Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, the call \"achieves nothing substantial, only pride in making what is an illusionary \\'groundbreaking move\\', and temporarily diverting public attention on the island away from her bad performance\". \"It would be a mistake for Tsai and her party to over-interpret the significance of the call,\" it said. Her attempts to \"stir up tension... will ultimately backfire\". The Global Times, a hawkish tabloid under the ruling Communist Party\\'s top newspaper the People\\'s Daily, called Trump \"bluffing and unpredictable\", but said he did not have plans to overturn America\\'s international relationships. \"It seems that Trump is still taking advantage of his perceived fickleness and unpredictability to make some choppy waves in the Taiwan Straits to see if he can gain some bargaining chips before he is sworn in,\" it said. The Global Times added targeting him would be inappropriate since he is not yet president. \"He has zero diplomatic experience and is unaware of the repercussions of shaking up Sino-U.S. relations,\" it said. Instead, China could send a message to Trump by punishing Taiwan, wooing away one or two of the island\\'s diplomatic allies or beefing up military deployments against Taiwan, it said. \"It is certain that Trump doesn\\'t want a showdown with China, because it is not his ambition, and neither was it included in his promise to the electorate. He puts out feelers to sound China out and chalk up some petty benefits.\" On Monday, Taiwan\\'s Liberty Times, considered close to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, reported Tsai is planning to transit in New York early next month on her way to visit three diplomatic allies - Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador. The trip would take place before Trump\\'s inauguration January 20 and Tsai\\'s delegation would seek to meet with Trump\\'s team, including Reince Priebus, Trump\\'s White House chief of staff, the report said. Taiwan\\'s Presidential Office said media reports about a January trip were \"excessive speculation\". It said it would announce any presidential trips at the appropriate time.',\n",

              " 'Indonesian police have pledged to bar Islamist groups from staging a rally on Friday at the Borobudur Buddhist temple in central Java to protest against the persecution of Myanmar s Rohingya Muslims. Islamist groups say they plan the demonstration close to the stupa-topped Borobudur temple, which dates from the 9th century and is a popular tourist site, to call for an end to violence against the religious and ethnic minority in Myanmar. Indonesia has the world s largest population of Muslims and there have been a number of anti-Myanmar protests in Jakarta and the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur over the treatment of Buddhist-majority Myanmar s roughly 1.1 million Rohingyas. Almost 125,000 Rohingyas have been forced to flee clashes between Rohingya insurgents and the army in the northwest Rakhine state. Tens of thousands have crossed the border into neighboring Bangladesh. The action at Borobudur temple will be prohibited, National Police Chief Tito Karnavian told reporters, according to media. This is not just part of the heritage of Indonesia, but that of the world. There is no need for protests in response to the Rohingya conflict because the Indonesian government is taking action on it already. Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi on Monday met Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi and top security officials to call for a halt to the bloodshed. Marsudi was due in Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, on Tuesday. Pakistani Foreign Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif expressed deep anguish at the ongoing violence against the Rohingya Muslims and urged the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to take immediate and effective action to bring an end to all human-rights violations against innocent and unarmed Rohingya Muslim population . An organizer of Friday s planned protest said the groups wanted to protest peacefully near the Borobodur temple to show Indonesia s tolerance. The Borobudur is an extraordinary symbol of tolerance, said Anang Imamuddin. We want the world to know that it is in a majority Muslim country but it is safe. Buddhist monks are safe here too.',\n",

The poll showed that more than 70 percent of both Senator Sanders\\' supporters and Secretary Clinton\\'s supporters would vote for the other Democratic candidate in a general election. and and roughly the same number and 72 percent of Senator Sanders\\' supporters said they would vote for Secretary Clinton, and 78 percent of Senator Sanders\\' supporters said they would vote for Secretary Clinton. In May of 2008, polling found only 60 percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for then-Senator Obama, who was eventually later elected to in a landslide victory. Furthermore, the poll shows that 80 percent of Democrats are \"mostly hopeful\" about the future of the Democratic Party, as opposed to only 55 percent of Republicans. 43 percent of Republicans are also \"mostly discouraged\" about the future of the Republican party. This echoes what we\\'ve seen in exit poll after exit poll after exit poll: Indiana : Three-quarters of Democrats in the state say they\\'ve been energized by the nomination contest between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen.

              " 'U.S. Senate Republicans have reached a tentative budget deal that could allow tax reform legislation to eliminate as much as $1.5 trillion in revenues over 10 years through tax cuts, raising the odds that their planned tax overhaul would expand the federal deficit. Two members of the Senate Budget Committee, Republicans Pat Toomey and Bob Corker, announced the formal agreement late on Tuesday, but their joint news release did not provide dollar figures for revenue reduction or tax cuts. The prospective tax cuts are part of closed-door talks among 12 Senate Budget Committee Republicans who are drafting a fiscal 2018 budget measure needed to help the 100-member Senate pass a tax overhaul with as few as 51 Republicans votes and prevent Democrats from blocking the legislation. The U.S. economy is in a steady expansion and stock markets are rising. But the tax cuts being weighed by congressional Republicans, with encouragement from President Donald Trump, are on a scale normally reserved for times of economic hardship and intended to drive annual economic growth above 3 percent. Trump campaigned last year on a promise of comprehensive tax reform. But Republicans have made little tangible progress toward that ambitious goal so far. Toomey told reporters he is confident that Republicans will agree to a budget resolution that foresees a deficit in the first decade. He said, however, that talks have not settled definitively on $1.5 trillion. \"I\\'d like to see a bigger number,\" said Toomey, who argues that tax cuts would increase economic growth. In their joint news release, Toomey and Corker said they agreed on a budget resolution that would use a standard analysis of the impact of the tax cuts on the deficit. Some Republicans like Toomey have pushed for a \"dynamic\" model, which tends to assume an increased economic stimulus effect from tax cuts, resulting in smaller projected increases to the deficit. Senator John Thune, a member of the Senate Republican leadership team, said he expected the agreement to provide maximum flexibility to craft a tax overhaul capable of driving economic growth and ultimately raising worker wages. But looming in the background is Washington\\'s steady flow of red ink that adds every year to the $20 trillion national debt, a target of outrage not long ago for Republican \"fiscal hawks.\" In recent weeks, some fiscal hawks have expressed a willingness to consider deficit financing for tax reform but many at levels well below $500 billion. Toomey\\'s comments suggest Senate Republicans may be looking to deficit spending as a way to cut taxes on businesses and individuals while avoiding hard decisions that would be needed to raise taxes elsewhere or eliminate popular tax breaks. If adopted by Congress in a budget resolution, the $1.5 trillion figure would set a ceiling on how much revenue tax reform could eliminate over 10 years. Analysts and Democrats have warned that higher deficits resulting from tax cuts would eventually overwhelm economic growth at a time when U.S. interest rates are set to rise. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, whose panel would use the budget figure in crafting a tax reform bill, told reporters he was not sure that revenue losses of $1.5 trillion were needed for tax reform. Senator Ron Wyden, the Senate Finance Committee\\'s top Democrat, dismissed the development as a distraction from the more important question of how Republican tax reform would ultimately benefit the wealthy. \"It looks to me like yet another trial balloon,\" Wyden said. Republicans have been unable to agree on how to pay for tax cuts and other proposed tax changes, aside from arguing that some lost revenue would be clawed back from the buoyant economic growth they believe tax reform will deliver. \"There\\'s no way you\\'re going to be able to do tax cuts that pay for themselves,\" said Louisiana Senator John Kennedy, another budget committee Republican. \"But I think most people would concede that cutting taxes does stimulate the economy.\"',\n",

              " 'In contrast to Obamacare, the Bush health plan envisions a much smaller role for government and a much bigger role for individual choice and competition in the marketplace. Bush health care differs from Obama health care in five significant ways: Without the employer mandate, all of the anti-job provisions in Obamacare would be gone. Right now employers have perverse incentives to keep the number of employees small, to reduce their hours of work and to use independent contractors and temp labor instead of full time employees. Under the Bush plan, no employer would be punished for creating jobs. Without the individual mandate, families would be free to buy insurance that meets individual and family needs rather than the needs of politicians. What woman would willingly choose to buy health insurance that offers free mammograms while she is healthy but makes her pay full price if there is a symptom of something wrong? That\\'s only one of the many needlessly wasteful and expensive consequences of letting health insurance benefits be determined by the political system. Also, without the individual mandate there is no reason for anybody to remain uninsured. The Bush tax credit is equal to the average tax subsidy received by employees who get their heath insurance at work. Let\\'s say a family, for whatever reason, had no additional disposable income. It would still be able to buy a health plan with its tax credit. Lower income families could qualify for additional help. I suspect they would always be able to buy Medicaid-like insurance with no additional cash outlay. But don\\'t we need mandates in order to keep people from gaming the system? We have found better ways in Medicare Part B, Medicare Part D and with Medigap insurance. In those markets, if you don\\'t buy when you are eligible, you can face penalties. In most places, if you don\\'t sign up for Medigap insurance when you are first eligible, you can be individually underwritten. The uniform tax credit is also a huge improvement. Because Obamacare conditions its subsidies on income, it raises the marginal tax rate for middle income families by six percentage points and in some cases far more. At 400 percent of poverty, a family can lose more than $10,000 in subsidies if it earns one additional dollar. At other \"cliff\" points, families can be subjected to thousands of dollars of additional exposure (higher deductibles and copayments) as a result of earning one more dollar. All these perversions vanish if everyone gets the same subsidy regardless of income. Also, if the subsidy doesn\\'t vary by income, all kinds of technical problems with healthcare.gov would vanish in a heartbeat. Virtually all the technical problems in the exchanges stem from the need to verify income. That means that the computers run by the exchanges have to interface with the computers of the IRS and other government agencies. Yet, in the main government, computer systems don\\'t know how to talk to each other and that\\'s a problem that may never be solved. If every one of the same age gets the same subsidy, the exchange doesn\\'t have to check with the IRS to verify income. Next April 15, there won\\'t be a plethora of additional taxes and refunds because almost everyone wrongly predicted his income for the previous year. According to H&R Block, as many as 3.4 million people got reduced refunds this year because they underestimated their income when they enrolled in ObamaCare insurance plans. The portability provision is another huge improvement over the current system. Right now if employers give employees pre-tax dollars to buy their own insurance in the individual market, the Obama administration is threatening to fine them $100 per employee per day. If you think that\\'s overkill, it tells you just how much the current administration dislikes employees buying and owning their own insurance. With the Bush plan, all the anti-portability provisions in current law will be gone.',\n",

              " 'STORRS, Conn. â€” One year ago, on the night after Super Bowl Sunday, Geno Auriemma sat alongside three stalwart seniors and momentarily imagined a coaching life without them. \"I start to blink because I look out there and start to think that these three are not going to be there next year,\" Auriemma, coach of the Connecticut women\\'s basketball powerhouse, said after a solid road victory over and South Carolina. He also appeared to be blinking away a tear or two at the thought of losing those three players: Breanna Stewart, Moriah Jefferson and Morgan Tuck. That moment of emotional reflection for Auriemma, who is better known for biting sarcasm, came after a 60th consecutive victory, to which the Huskies predictably added 15 more on the way to their fourth straight (and 11th overall) national championship. Not many, including Auriemma, would have bet the mortgage on the streaks â€” both in games and titles â€” lasting much longer. But on Monday night, in a and expectant Gampel Pavilion, the Huskies made it an even 100 straight victories, swarming that same South Carolina team, to cross the threshold. The Huskies did it behind their forwards, Gabby Williams and Napheesa Collier. Williams scored 26 points and grabbed 14 rebounds while Collier added 18 and 9. \"Continuing what they\\'ve done for so many years,\" said Williams, referring to past iconic Huskies, several of whom, Stewart included, watched from the stands. It starts to sound ridiculous, but the Huskies, this season, have not lost since November 2014 (in overtime at Stanford). If not for that loss, they\\'d be working on a streak of 148 straight. Even Auriemma sounded at a loss to explain this. He settled on \"it was meant to be\" after weeks of insisting that he and his players never talked about No. 100. Against the and No. 6 Gamecocks, the subject was unavoidable. And after 12 successive blowouts in an American Athletic Conference in which the Huskies have gone since its formation, the prospect of stiffer competition was preferable. With an eye on bigger game, the N. C. A. A. tournament, Auriemma said: \"The streak isn\\'t all theirs. They carried the streak across the finish line. But if they win the national championship, it\\'s all theirs. \" It\\'s not as if the act of breaking records is new to his program. A previous record winning streak (surpassing the U. C. L. A. men\\'s record established from 1971 to 1974) was bested by the current run last month. There is no doubt that a potential fifth straight national title, and 12th over all, are numbers more appealing to Auriemma. But triple digits in consecutive wins represents another symbolic groundbreaking and powerful statement in the continued and collective excellence of a women\\'s sports team. Only once had Auriemma\\'s program come this close to 100 â€” a winning streak that stood at 99 when an upstart St. John\\'s team won at Gampel in February 2012, before Connecticut\\'s departure from what was then a highly competitive Big East Conference. \"Senior night, packed house at Gampel, as always,\" Kim Barnes Arico â€” then the St. John\\'s coach, now in her fifth season at Michigan, where she has built a team â€” said in a telephone interview. With St. John\\'s trailing by 2 points in the final seconds, Barnes Arico decided during a timeout to try for the win rather than overtime in such a challenging environment. Shenneika Smith â€” \"she hadn\\'t made a 3 in weeks\" â€” sank the winning shot. On the bus ride home, Barnes Arico\\'s cellphone rang. \"It\\'s Geno, calling to congratulate me after what had to be a crushing loss,\" Barnes Arico said. Auriemma had been supportive of her efforts to elevate the St. John\\'s program, which is why, she said, \"I can\\'t help but applaud what he\\'s doing there, going for 100 straight, just incredible. \" That said, she was \"holding off\" on reaching out, or rooting for either side on Monday, given her ties to South Carolina Coach Dawn Staley. Barnes Arico has coached and U. S. A. Basketball teams with Staley, a Olympian and, like Auriemma, a Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame member. \"Either way, such a great story,\" Barnes Arico said. Staley\\'s team â€” as have most ranked teams â€” presented Connecticut with its usual handicap of a size disadvantage, with their star, A\\'ja Wilson, and the center Alaina Coates. But the Huskies countered with Williams, only and Collier, â€” both quick jumpers who play bigger than they are. After Wilson helped keep the Gamecocks within at the half, the Huskies limited her to 5 points. They took control late in the third quarter and were never threatened in the fourth. \"You can\\'t let your guard down â€” UConn is going to make you pay every time,\" Staley said. In surmounting every obstacle on a schedule with opponents, Auriemma rapidly developed a cohesive Core Four to replace the Big Three of Stewart, Jefferson and Tuck, who were the top three picks in last year\\'s W. N. B. A. draft. \"We have no preseason but we have four really good players, and every time we need something, one of them comes up with something,\" Auriemma said, referring to the juniors Williams and Kia Nurse, and the sophomores Katie Lou Samuelson and Collier. If this wasn\\'t supposed to be a season of extended dominance, the question entering Monday night had evolved. Would the Huskies ever lose? \"It\\'s not if,\" Auriemma said, \"it\\'s just when. \" But if not Monday night, or sometime this season, just when? Next season, Connecticut is planning to suit up Azura Stevens, a transfer from Duke who many believe would have been UConn\\'s best player this season. The Huskies will add Megan Walker, rated by some as the nation\\'s No. 1 high school recruit. They will return six of their seven rotation players, the exception being Saniya Chong, who shares the position with the freshman Crystal Dangerfield. With no formidable opponent left on the conference schedule, and victories over many of the teams already recorded, an inquiring mind wants to wonder whether the Huskies might in a couple of years be on the doorstep of 200.',\n",

              " 'You are here: Home / political cartoon / What Marketing Obamacare Really Looks Like [Cartoon] What Marketing Obamacare Really Looks Like [Cartoon] October 28, 2016 Pinterest  C.E. Dyer reports that the disaster that is Obamacare is about to get worse for many people enrolled in the health insurance marketplace. On Monday, the Obama administration confirmed that premiums will skyrocket for many people next year, according to the Associated Press .  The AP reported:  Before taxpayer-provided subsidies, premiums for a midlevel benchmark plan will increase an average of 25 percent across the 39 states served by the federally run online market, according to a report from the Department of Health and Human Services. Some states will see much bigger jumps, others less.  Moreover, about 1 in 5 consumers will only have plans from a single insurer to pick from, after major national carriers such as UnitedHealth Group, Humana and Aetna scaled back their roles.  In some states, the premium increases are striking. In Arizona, unsubsidized premiums for a hypothetical 27-year-old buying a benchmark \"second-lowest cost silver plan\" will jump by 116 percent, from $196 to $422, according to the administration report.  But HHS said if that hypothetical consumer has a fairly modest income, making $25,000 a year, the subsidies would cover $280 of the new premium, and the consumer would pay $142. Caveat: if the consumer is making $30,000 or $40,000 his or her subsidy would be significantly lower.  Larry Levitt, who follows the health care law for the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, said of the increases: \"Consumers will be faced this year with not only big premium increases but also with a declining number of insurers participating, and that will lead to a tumultuous open enrollment period.\"  Donald Trump\\'s campaign spokesman, Jason Miller, said in a statement on Monday: \"This shows why the entire program must be repealed and replaced.\" Miller added, \"While (Hillary) Clinton wants to expand the failed program known as Obamacare, Mr. Trump knows the only way to fix our nation\\'s failing health care system is complete and total reform.\"  Reports have warned that this was coming down the pike for some time; however, HHS\\'s confirmation ahead of open enrollment beginning Nov. 1 â€” one week before the election â€” is likely to cause major headaches for many people.  This debacle is not unexpected either â€” it\\'s exactly what President Obama and Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton wanted to happen.  Obamacare was never the end goal. Rather, it was a stepping stone toward single-payer, government-run healthcare. That is a big reason why Obama wants Clinton to become president â€” his legacy is at stake.  Obama\\'s legacy is largely wrapped up in Obamacare and what it leads to. Clinton tried to push this first step during her time as first lady and failed, but the conditions will be ripe for her to go even further should she be elected.  If Clinton becomes president, there\\'s no doubt that her next step will be to move to single-payer healthcare. Obamacare is bad, there\\'s no doubt about it, but single-payer government healthcare would be even worse.',\n",

              " 'Pope Francis issued a stinging new critique of the Vatican s top administration on Thursday, saying traitors stood in the way of his reforms and made any change as hard as cleaning Egypt s Sphinx with a toothbrush . For the fourth year running, Francis used his annual Christmas greetings to the Roman Catholic Church s central bureaucracy, or Curia, to lecture the assembled cardinals, bishops and other department heads on the need for change. Reforming Rome is like cleaning the Sphinx of Egypt with a toothbrush, he said, quoting a 19th-century Belgian churchman. The phrase did not evoke much laughter when the pope read it in the frescoed Clementina Hall of the Vatican s Apostolic Palace. Since his election as the first Latin American pope in 2013, Francis has been trying to reform the Italian-dominated Curia to bring the Church s hierarchy closer to its members, to enact financial reforms and guide it out of scandals that marked the pontificate of his predecessor, former Pope Benedict. But he has encountered resistance, particularly as some departments have been closed, merged or streamlined. Francis said some in the bureaucracy - the nerve center of the 1.2-billion-member Church and whose members are entrusted with carrying out the pope s decisions - were part of cliques and plots . Francis called this unbalanced and degenerate and a cancer that leads to a self-referential attitude . In his address on Thursday, he spoke of those traitors of trust who had been entrusted with carrying out reforms but let themselves be corrupted by ambition and vainglory. When they are quietly let go, he said, they erroneously declare themselves to be martyrs of the system ... instead of reciting a mea culpa (Latin for my fault ). Francis did not cite any specific examples. Last June the Vatican s first auditor general resigned suddenly. He later said he was forced to step down because he had discovered irregularities but the Vatican said he had been spying on his superiors. Earlier this month, the Vatican bank s deputy director was fired under circumstances that have not been explained. In July, in a major shake-up of the Vatican administration, Francis replaced Catholicism s top theologian, a conservative German cardinal who has been at odds with the pontiff s vision of a more inclusive Church. Francis said the overwhelming majority of Curia members were faithful, competent and some saintly. Later, in a separate meeting with lay Vatican employees and their families, Francis asked forgiveness for the failings of some Church officials. He spoke hours before the funeral of Cardinal Bernard Law, the ex-Archbishop of Boston who resigned in disgrace after covering up years of sexual abuse of children by priests and whose name became a byword for scandal in the Catholic Church.',\n",

[\"Executives at three top Japanese companies said officials had been in touch asking for investment numbers. Public investment institutions say the prime minister is also leaning on them to pledge tens of billions of dollars to US infrastructure projects such as rail,\" reports the Financial Times. Abe is scheduled to arrive in the United States for his meeting with Trump on Friday, with his foreign, finance, and trade ministers in tow. On Saturday, he\\'ll join Trump for a round of golf at the resort in Florida. \"You get to know somebody better on a golf course than you will over lunch,\" Trump explained in a radio interview on Sunday. He did not confirm or deny whether there would be any money riding on the game. There will definitely be a lot of money riding on Abe\\'s visit. The Financial Times has Sadayuki Sakakibara, chairman of the Nippon Keidanren business federation â€” saluted as the \" voice of corporate Japan\" by the Japan Times and its chairman regarded as \"the prime minister of the business world\" â€” scrambling to assemble data that will help Trump see Japan in a positive light. \"The most important thing is to reconfirm the importance of the relationship in politics, economics, and security,\" Sakakibara said. To that end, he wants Abe to remind Trump that \"we\\'re contributing to the expansion of U. S. exports,\" along with $400 billion of direct investment and 1. 7 million jobs supported by Japanese companies in America. The Financial Times also notes that Toyota has already pledged another $10 billion in U. S. investment over the next five years, with up to 400 jobs added at its Indiana manufacturing plant. Japan\\'s SoftBank tech conglomerate has also pledged $50 billion in American investment over the next four years. Abe will add to this by discussing Japanese investment for Trump\\'s proposed infrastructure plan, possibly including a sales pitch for Japanese rail technology. In 2015, Abe proposed $5 billion in Japanese investment for a maglev train that would have offered travel from D. C. to Baltimore in 15 minutes, with a vision of similar lines connecting New York to Washington, Dallas to Houston, and Los Angeles to San Francisco.',\n",

He also made one joke in a 2000 Salon.com essay just as presidential election season started picking up steam. Here s the remark: I have tremendous respect for McCain but I don t buy the war hero thing. Anybody can be captured. I thought the idea was to capture them. As far as I m concerned he sat out the war. Before everyone suggests Franken need to apologize just like Donald Trump should, here s why this is different: Back in 2000, Franken was not a political figure. He wasn t a sitting anything or a candidate for anything; the closest he came to political officialdom was as a revered satirist. More importantly, he even re-told the joke to McCain s face in 2004, when the senator was on Franken s own radio show.Here s how Franken s spokesperson commented on the joke:The fact that a statement came so quickly from Franken s office demonstrates that he is well-aware it is a terrible thing to say about McCain.On the other hand, Trump is not just not apologizing, he s doubling down.

              " 'Prof. Tony Hall Speaks Out on Mohawk Territory 2 Shares 1 0 0 1 Prof. Hall speaks at the Haldimand Deed Recognition Dinner at Kanata in the Mohawk Village near Brantford Ontario. Prof. Hall has been the target of a witch hunt mounted by Facebook and by B\\'nai Brith Canada. The mission of the Canadian branch of the Anti-Defamation League is to provide Zionist advocacy for \"the security of Israel.\" In late August of 2016 a maliciously engineered smear item was placed on Prof. Hall\\'s FB page without his knowledge or consent. The B\\'nai Brith immediately publicized the offensive content of the post to introduce a concerted smear and disinformation campaign implying falsely that Dr. Hall seeks to \"Kill All Jews.\" The B\\'nai Brith exploited its grotesque misrepresentation of Dr. Hall\\'s academic work to call on its membership to flood the administrative offices of the University of Lethbridge with letters and petition signatures. The object is to remove Dr. Hall from his teaching post. Dr. Hall remains a tenured full professor whose career as a university teacher began in 1982. The University of Lethbridge\\'s administration soon surrendered to this Zionist campaign aimed at disabling an outspoken critic of Israel\\'s genocidal treatment of the Aboriginal Palestinians. On Oct. 4 the U of L president, Dr. Mike Mahon, suspended Dr. Hall without pay. He undertook this assault on the principles of academic freedom in the complete absence of any due process of third-party arbitration whatsoever. The attack on Dr. Hall is an attack on the institution of academic tenure, a mainstay of protection for academic freedom in institutions of higher learning. The University of Lethbridge Faculty Association and the Canadian Association of University Teachers have identified the illegal nature of Dr. Mahon\\'s unprecedented assault on the core principles of tenure and academic freedom. In his talk sponsored by the Mohawks of the Grand River, Dr. Hall put the Zionist/Facebook campaign directed at disabling critics of Israel in a broader historical context. The assault on the Palestinian people extends the genocidal holocaust directed at the Indigenous peoples of the Americas since 1492. Israeli techniques directed at terminating the Palestinian presence draw on the genocidal techniques directed at Native Americans in the expansionary course of US history. WRITER Prof. Tony Hall Dr. Hall is editor in chief of American Herald Tribune. He is currently Professor of Globalization Studies at University of Lethbridge in Alberta Canada. He has been a teacher in the Canadian university system since 1982. Dr. Hall, has recently finished a big two-volume publishing project at McGill-Queen\\'s University Press entitled \"The Bowl with One Spoon\".',\n",

              " 'President Vladimir Putin on Thursday accused American politicians of whipping up hysteria about a mythical Russian threat as a ploy to distract voters from their own failings in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election. Putin, addressing an audience of foreign policy experts gathered in southern Russia, repeatedly lashed out at the Obama administration, saying it did not keep its word on Syria, did not honour deals, and had falsely accused Moscow of all manner of sins. The U.S. government has formally accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organisations, while Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has accused Republican rival Donald Trump of being a Putin \"puppet\". Putin said he found it hard to believe that anyone seriously thought Moscow was capable of influencing the Nov. 8 election. \"Hysteria has been whipped up,\" said Putin. He said that was a ruse to cover up for the fact that the U.S. political elite had nothing to say about serious issues such as the country\\'s national debt or gun control. \"It\\'s much simpler to distract people with so-called Russian hackers, spies, and agents of influence. Does anyone really think that Russia could influence the American people\\'s choice in any way? Is America a banana republic or what? America is a great power.\" In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest dismissed Putin\\'s remarks as predictable and said the United States stood by its hacking allegations. \"There\\'s nothing that President Putin had to say today that I find particularly surprising or that in any way undermines the president\\'s confidence in the analysis that\\'s been released by the Department of Homeland Security and the intelligence community,\" said Earnest. Russian state TV and some of his past comments have suggested the Russian leader favours Trump, but Putin said he did not back any candidate in the U.S. election and was ready to work with any new U.S. president and to discuss any issue. Asked about Trump, whom he once described as \"very talented,\" Putin said the Republican candidate was deliberately adopting a showy style because he wanted to get his message across and that he represented ordinary voters fed up with the U.S. political elite. \"He has chosen a method to get through to voters\\' hearts,\" said Putin. \"He behaves extravagantly of course, we see this, but I think there\\'s a reason for this.\" Putin dismissed suggestions by some politicians in the West that Russia is poised to attack another country or intervene elsewhere in the Middle East apart from Syria. Such talk was designed to exaggerate the threat that Russia posed, he said, in order for certain countries to secure higher military spending and talk up their own importance. He said Russia was not planning to attack anyone. But he made clear Russia was in Syria for the long haul and intended to clear the city of Aleppo of what he called \"a nest of terrorists\", while trying to minimise civilian casualties.',\n",

              " 'When the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, said on Tuesday that his investigators had no \"direct evidence\" that Hillary Clinton\\'s email account had been \"successfully hacked,\" both private experts and federal investigators immediately understood his meaning: It very likely had been breached, but the intruders were far too skilled to leave evidence of their work. Mr. Comey described, in fairly blistering terms, a set of email practices that left Mrs. Clinton\\'s systems wide open to Russian and Chinese hackers, and an array of others. She had no cybersecurity professional monitoring her system. She took her BlackBerry everywhere she went, \"sending and receiving emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. \" Her use of \"a personal email domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent. \" In the end, the risks created by Mrs. Clinton\\'s insistence on keeping her communications on a private server may prove to be a larger issue than the relatively small amount of classified data investigators said they found on her system. But the central mystery â€” who got into the system, if anyone â€” may never be resolved. \"Reading between the lines and following Comey\\'s logic, it does sound as if the F. B. I. believes a compromise of Clinton\\'s email is more likely than not,\" said Adam Segal, the author of \"Hacked World Order,\" who studies cyberissues at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"Sophisticated attackers would have known of the existence of the account, would have targeted it and would not have been seen. \" Mr. Comey couched his concern on Tuesday by repeating the intelligence community\\'s favorite phrase â€” \"we assess\" â€” four times, but ultimately reached no conclusion. \"We assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton\\'s personal email account,\" he said. But that was notable: Until Mr. Comey spoke, Mrs. Clinton and her campaign have said that her server â€” there were actually several, in succession â€” was never hacked. A State Department inspector general\\'s report issued this year reported what looked like several attempts at \"spear phishing\" â€” fake emails intended to get a user to click on a link that would install malware on a computer â€” but there is no evidence that those links were activated. Mrs. Clinton, and her campaign, have always maintained that the server was secure. President Obama backed her up in an interview last October on CBS\\'s \"60 Minutes. \" \"I don\\'t think it posed a national security problem,\" he said. But Mr. Comey painted a different picture. \"Hostile actors gained access to the private commercial email accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact,\" he said. And that would have meant that tracking the trail of electronic breadcrumbs back to her server would have been a pretty simple task. After that, their ability to break in would have been a mix of skill and luck, but they had plenty of time to get it right. Mrs. Clinton\\'s best defense, and one she cannot utter in public, is that whatever the risks of keeping her own email server, that server was certainly no more vulnerable than the State Department\\'s. Had she held an unclassified account in the State Department\\'s official system, as the rules required, she certainly would have been hacked. Russian intruders were thoroughly inside that system for years â€” since at least 2007 â€” before the State Department shut its system down several times to perform a digital exorcism in late 2014, nearly two years after Mrs. Clinton left office. Either out of embarrassment or to protect its sources of intelligence, the Obama administration has never publicly blamed Russia for stealing data from the unclassified systems at the State Department and the White House, just as it has never publicly identified China as the culprit in the theft of information on nearly 22 million Americans stored by the Office of Personnel Management. Mrs. Clinton\\'s campaign has insisted that the server did have some cyber protection software, but they have not said what kind. But security software is useless unless it is updated constantly to reflect threats that change every day. Even then, there are ways for a determined, hacker to get in. The best hackers use a gap in the software that has never been discovered before called a \"zero day,\" suggesting there are zero days of warning about its dangers, or they wait for a user error, including clicking on a link. Perhaps Mr. Comey\\'s most surprising suggestion was that Mrs. Clinton had used her private email while in the territory of what he called \"sophisticated adversaries. \" That usually means China and Russia, but could include visits elsewhere, including Eastern Europe. James A. Lewis, a former government cyber security expert who now studies the cyber activities of nations at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said, \"If she used it in Russia or China, they almost certainly picked it up. \" Once the hardware is in a foreign country, and on its phone networks, it is particularly vulnerable. Malware can be placed on it that could turn the phone into a listening device. One lurking question is whether Mrs. Clinton\\'s own practice of taking the phone around the world made it susceptible to tinkering by a foreign government. The State Department worries so much about corrupted cellphones that visitors to the secretary\\'s suite on the seventh floor must place their devices in lockers near the guard\\'s desk. Mrs. Clinton, her campaign said on Wednesday, took her smartphone to the State Department but kept it in a room outside the secure area around her office suite. Moreover, for truly sensitive data, the State Department does not use its own networks at all. It quietly uses a network run by one of the major intelligence agencies, according to officials familiar with the system. That suggests a lack of confidence that State\\'s classified systems can be fully trusted. Since the disclosure that Mrs. Clinton used private email, officials in the government and many outside it have been monitoring the internet, looking to see if any of her messages, or those directed to her, made their way into the public domain. Documents from the Democratic National Committee began circulating after it announced a breach that also appears to have been conducted by Russian intelligence. Nothing from Mrs. Clinton has surfaced. But that does not mean they were not stolen, only that they have not been made public.',\n",

According to Kenneth Meshoe, chairman of the African Christian Democratic Party faction, any attempt to compare Palestinians\\' experience in Israel with the former racist regime is offensive to individuals who suffered under the system of racial separation.  Whatever challenges the Arab minority in Israel faces, the reality of life here cannot be compared to his experiences growing up, he insists.  \"There is freedom of movement in this country that we never had in South Africa,\" Meshoe told Tazpit Press Service (TPS) during a visit to Jerusalem last week. \"Benches and bathrooms said \\'whites only.\\' We could never take \\'white\\' transportation. Most white doctors would not treat black patients, only white ones. And those who were willing to treat black patients out of compassion â€“ many of them would ask the patients to enter their clinics through the back door so they wouldn\\'t be seen by the white patients in the lobby. I don\\'t know if it was illegal for white doctors to treat black patients, but the reality was that very few did.\" \\'Perpetuating Propaganda\\'  According to Meshoe, \"Some South Africans who say there\\'s apartheid in Israel are only repeating things they\\'ve heard from other people, not because they\\'ve actually seen it themselves. They are just perpetuating propaganda.  \"Other people â€“ politicians â€“ are only thinking about their needs, and the statements that will serve their needs. They ask \\'what do I gain [by claiming there is or is not apartheid in Israel] and then make a decision. So they are perpetuating something that that they know very well is a lie.\"  Meshoe said he first visited Israel several years after Nelson Mandela was elected president in 1994. He joined a church delegation to the Holy Land and used the opportunity both for a religious pilgrimage and a political education, but the latter came as a surprise.  \"On that trip, I deliberately looked for anything that looked like apartheid.

There have long been suspicions that the Kurds, who let thousands of ISIS oil trucks through their region each week, have been working with ISIS all along. It was the Kurds, not the real Kurds, but Barzani\\'s Saudi run dictatorship in Erbil, that invited Turkey into Iraq. Deputy Chief of the Nineveh Provincial Council Noureddin Qablan announced that the US-led coalition warplanes have launched airstrikes on army base in Nineveh province, killing several soldiers. \"The US fighter jets hit one of the military bases of Iraqi Army\\'s 16th Division in a region North of Mosul, and the attack left at least four Iraqi soldiers dead,\" Qablan said. According to FNA, He said that the US army has confirmed the attack, calling it a \"mistake\". Qablan said that it is not the first time the US warplanes hit the Iraqi army and volunteer forces (Hashd al-Shaabi) military positions, adding, \"The US-led coalition has each time said that air raids were not deliberate.\" It is reported that another peshmerga convoy accidentally hit by an USA-led coalition airstrike near Mosul today. That\\'s was 3 \"Mistakan Raid\" in 24 hours.

I say he is technically the governor of Maine because the word itself implies governing as in working and doing a job. LePage does virtually none of that.The latest crusade of stupidity he has embarked upon is the outright refusal to perform his constitutional duty and swear in a new state senator, who recently won a special election. This leaves people of his state without representation in their capitol and shows yet again why the phrase tea party automatically disqualifies from any position of authority in any job.Susan Deschambault, a Biddeford Democrat, won a special election for the Senate District 32 seat on Tuesday. She traveled to the capitol with her family to be sworn in, only to be told the governor refused to do it. His reason is even worse than his behavior. LePage won t swear her in because of a totally unrelated issue where the senate has rejected the confirmation of the governor s nominee to the state s unemployment insurance commission.Deschambault literally has NOTHING to do with any of this, but he is denying her the ability to do her job, denying her constituents representation, denying Maine a fully-functional state house and violating his oath of office as governor just because he is an overgrown child who wants to have a tantrum.Tea Partiers are not the brightest bulb in the room normally. However, this move really is beyond reason even for them. We have a sitting U.S. governor who is literally holding his own state s ability to govern itself hostage until he gets his way.

              " 'During a recent appearance on Good Morning Britain, Donald Trump made several claims about Muslims that are, perhaps unsurprisingly to most people, completely bogus. During the interview, Trump claimed that one of the biggest challenges in the fight against terrorism is that good Muslims are withholding information about terrorist plots. It s like they re protecting each other, Trump said during the interview. They have to report the bad ones. And if you report the bad ones, then all of a sudden you re not going to have the problems. Here s the interview:This statement does not hold up to empirical evidence. Muslims do in fact quit often turn in radical extremists. Vox reports: In 2014, University of North Carolina sociologist Charles Kurzman identified 188 cases since 9/11 where the police had publicly identified a Muslim American as a suspected terrorist and disclosed where the initial tip came from. Of those 188, 54 individuals were brought to the government s attention via tips from members of the Muslim-American community. Muslim Americans were the single largest source of tips identified in Kurzman s study. To further illustrate the stupidity of Trump s claims, let s look at some other facts. Trump is implying that it is the Muslim population s responsibility to report problems to the authorities. By doing so he is placing responsibility for the actions of terrorists on Muslim communities shoulders.There are approximately 1.6 billion Muslims in the world. That s about 23% of the world s entire population. Only about 3.3 million Muslims lives in the United States. During this interview, and for the entirety of his campaign, Trump has been using nearly a quarter of the world s population as a political scapegoat. The reality is that the Islamic State and other terror groups are followers of Salafi Jihadism. They are a relatively tiny cult of extremists, that mainly live in concentrated geographic regions.The chance that a Muslim person would actually know a Jihadist is pretty slim. The odds that they might stumble upon information about a possible terror plot is even slimmer. When we take that into account, and we look at the number of tips that come from Muslims about possible terror attacks since 9/11 it becomes quite clear that Muslims do almost always turn in information regarding possible terrorist activities when they come across it and they know what they have come across.It s almost as if Muslims almost always do the reasonable thing that anyone would do if they were in that situation.Of course, none of this will probably matter to Trump or his followers.

Senior Airman Brian Kolfage Jr is a good friend and recipient of the WWP s 2014 George C. Lang Award for Courage.The George C. Lang Award for Courage PRESENTED TO BRIAN KOLFAGE Jr. from Brian on Vimeo.Sales from the newly released DVD of American Sniper are expected to generate a million dollars for the Wounded Warrior Project (WWP), a charitable organization founded to honor and empower U.S. veterans and armed service members who incurred a physical or mental injury after 9/11.A Warner Bros. production company statement says that one dollar of each purchase of the DVD, between its release on Tuesday and December 31, will be donated to WWP, up to $1 million from sales.American Sniper was based on the autobiography of Chris Kyle, a runaway bestseller which spent 18 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, 13 of those at number one. Kyle is thought to have been the most lethal Navy SEAL sniper in American history with 160 confirmed kills.The blockbuster film, which was unabashedly pro-War on Terror, was a massive box office success and out-grossed every other film released in 2014, including The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 and Guardians of the Galaxy. The film grossed some $543 million worldwide.According to The Christian Post, Kyle personally wanted Clint Eastwood to direct the film, and after his tragic death the producers approached Eastwood who agreed to sign on as director of the project.Together with his friend, Chad Littlefield, Kyle was shot and killed by a Marine that he was trying to help overcome PTSD while at a Texas gun range in 2013, not long before the film went into production.Chris Kyle was a Christian whose father served as a deacon and whose mother taught Sunday school. He believed in the morality of what he did as a Navy SEAL sniper, and felt that on Judgment Day he would have things to answer for, but that his service as a SEAL wouldn t be one of them. In his autobiography, Kyle wrote:I believe the fact that I ve accepted Jesus as my savior will be my salvation. But in that backroom or whatever it is when God confronts me with my sins, I do not believe any of the kills I had during the war will be among them. Everyone I shot was evil. I had good cause on every shot. They all deserved to die.',\n",

For example, what I sent them included: The DNC Chair has repeatedly said on the air and otherwise that it\\'s not her job to tell either candidate to get out and has never called for anyone to get out of the race. She has talked in very positive terms about both of our candidates and the substantive campaigns they\\'ve run . As for the stuff that Joe and Mika tried to rehash this morning about debates, the fact is our debates earned far better ratings overall this year than they did in past cycles. And as NBC knows all too well, when we were able to get both campaigns to agree, we added four. The rules in place for this election have been pretty much the same for several cycles. In fact, the major change from 2008 â€“ when Obama beat Clinton --- is that there are actually LESS unpledged \"super\" delegates, now down to 15% from 20% prior to the change. No one wrote or rewrote any rules to help or hurt any specific candidate, these are the Party rules. The single biggest factor determining the nominee (85%) is the participation of voters in primaries and caucuses. You can see a post we did here that lays out the facts on Super Delegates . It also debunks the false myths about Iowa. The DNC\\'s delegate selection rules for this primary were set before any of these candidates declared, and are consistent with the rules in place for several cycles â€“ including 2008 when Barack Obama defeated Hillary Clinton.

Bernie Sanders faces a \\'then what\\' problem 05/19/16 08:53 AMâ€”UPDATED 05/19/16 08:55 AM facebook twitter 1 save share group 93 By Steve Benen It\\'s safe to say May hasn\\'t gone quite as well as Bernie Sanders and his supporters had hoped. He needed landslide victories in several primaries, and he came up short. After steadily gaining on Hillary Clinton in national Democratic polls for months, the senator has seen his support slip in recent weeks. In Nevada, Sanders\\' supporters caused a near-riot at the state Democratic convention, based on allegations of party wrongdoing that have struggled to withstand scrutiny . Sanders\\' candidacy has had some highs and some lows, but all things considered, this hasn\\'t exactly been a month to remember. For his legions of supporters, it\\'s no doubt discouraging. The race for the Democratic nomination, however, still has about a month to go, and the New York Times reports that Team Sanders isn\\'t backing down, delegate arithmetic notwithstanding. Defiant and determined to transform the Democratic Party, Senator Bernie Sanders is opening a two-month phase of his presidential campaign aimed at inflicting a heavy blow on Hillary Clinton in California and amassing enough leverage to advance his agenda at the convention in July â€“ or even wrest the nomination from her. It\\'s at this point when Sanders and campaign operation start to run into a \"then what?\" problem. According to the Times\\' piece, for example, Team Sanders believes it may yet win the California primary, where polls show him trailing, which might have \"a psychological impact\" on Democrats. OK, but then what? If the idea is that Democratic insiders will ignore the will of the voters and the delegate count because of one primary result, awarding Sanders the nomination despite his second-place finish, there\\'s no reason to believe such a scenario is plausible. The same article said Team Sanders is willing to hurt Clinton, on purpose, even as the general-election phase gets underway. OK, but then what? There\\'s still no reason to believe this will prompt party officials to override the primary and caucus results. A Sanders supporter told the Times, \"We want to have progressive values and socialism on the convention\\'s agenda.\" OK, but then what? It\\'s not clear how, exactly, one puts \"socialism\" on the \"agenda,\" but even if that were possible, what happens afterwards? Tad Devine, a top Sanders strategist, told the Washington Post\\'s Greg Sargent yesterday that the Sanders campaign may ask for some changes among convention committee assignments. OK, but then what? What are the practical effects of changing which Democrats sit on which convention committees, and why should a second-place candidate dictate convention committees\\' membership? There are rumors about Sanders supporters preparing for civil disobedience and organized disruptions at the Democratic convention itself. OK, but then what? History has shown that convention protests, even intra-party protests, can lead to meaningful change, but even if progressive activists literally started fires on the convention floor, in a display of violent catharsis, how does that bring Sanders and his allies any closer to their goals? The Times article added this key paragraph: [Sanders\\'] newly resolute attitude is also the cumulative result of months of anger at the national Democratic Party over a debate schedule that his campaign said favored Mrs. Clinton; a fund-raising arrangement between the party and the Clinton campaign; the appointment of fierce Clinton partisans as leaders of important convention committees; and the party\\'s rebuke of Mr. Sanders on Tuesday for not clearly condemning a melee at the Nevada Democratic convention on Saturday. It\\'s worth noting, however, that the national Democratic Party agreed to expand the debate schedule, and it offered Sanders literally the identical fundraising arrangement it struck with the Clinton campaign. Democratic officials also worked to make sure Sanders appeared on the New Hampshire and D.C. primary ballots, even after procedural and legal questions arose surrounding his eligibility â€“ steps the DNC wouldn\\'t have taken if it were trying to rig the process against him. There\\'s still time to avoid scenarios that could prove costly in the fall, but not a lot of time. Sanders believes, accurately, that he has some leverage: if he\\'s not satisfied with how the process unfolds in the coming weeks, the senator can sabotage the party\\'s ticket and elect President Trump. What\\'s less clear is what he\\'ll demand in exchange for his supp',\n",

[Frederick County Public Schools has fired employee Katie Nash after she stirred up attention on how she ran the district\\'s Twitter feed last week, the Frederick News Post reported. On Jan. 5, a student tweeted to the FCPS Twitter account @FCPSMaryland and said, \"close school tammarow PLEASE. \" Several hours later, Frederick County Public Schools Social Media Manager Katie Nash replied, \"but then how would you learn how to spell \\'tomorrow?\\' :)\" The response drew lots of attention and backlash over social media as thousands of people liked and retweeted the post.

Nash said she understands why she was fired and said she doesn\\'t want to be a \"distraction\" to the school system, but thought her employer would have provided some suggestions on how to improve her job. \"As a new employee, I think I sort of would have expected that there would have been some counseling or some suggestions on how to improve,\" she said. Nash had decided to take a more playful tone on the school\\'s Twitter account, citing student feedback. \"We had received feedback from some students in a focus group that our tweeting was a bit flat, they were looking for some more engagement,\" Nash said. \"They were looking for us to tweet back at them and I really took that to heart because I know that I am a little bit older and maybe not as hip as some of the students are, so I took that to heart and I took that feedback in. \" The student later said that he didn\\'t take the tweet personally, WGHP reported.

              " 'President Trump lashed out at the nation\\'s intelligence agencies again on Wednesday, saying that his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, was brought down by illegal leaks to the news media, on a day of new disclosures about the Trump camp\\'s dealings with Russia during and after the presidential campaign. \"From intelligence, papers are being leaked, things are being leaked,\" Mr. Trump said at a White House news conference with Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel. \"It\\'s a criminal action, criminal act, and it\\'s been going on for a long time before me, but now it\\'s really going on. And people are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton. \" With his statement and a burst of posts he made on Twitter, Mr. Trump tried to shift attention from damaging questions about contacts with Russia by Mr. Flynn and others close to the president, arguing that the outrage is not those contacts, but the leaks about them. He revived his charge that the allegations of a \"Russian connection\" were nothing more than a Democratic conspiracy, fed to a receptive news media to distract from the mistakes made by Mrs. Clinton during the campaign. The White House has said that Mr. Trump demanded Mr. Flynn\\'s resignation on Monday night, after it was revealed that Mr. Flynn, a retired Army general, had misled Vice President Mike Pence and other officials about his conversations with a Russian diplomat. But on Wednesday, the president said that Mr. Flynn had \"been treated very, very unfairly by the media,\" undercut by \"documents and papers that were illegally â€” I\\'d stress that, illegally â€” leaked. \" Earlier, he had posted on Twitter, \"Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI? ). Just like Russia\" The New York Times and The Washington Post had reported on the contacts Mr. Flynn had with Russia\\'s ambassador to Washington, Sergey I. Kislyak. Mr. Flynn initially told Mr. Pence and others that he and Mr. Kislyak did not discuss matters of substance, like United States sanctions against Russia, but in the days after Mr. Trump\\'s inauguration, the Justice Department notified the White House that he had not been forthright about the conversations. The Times also disclosed broader contacts between Russian intelligence officials and people with ties to the Trump campaign and Mr. Trump\\'s business empire during and after the campaign, and other news organizations followed with similar reports. The president declined to address that revelation and, as he has at other times in recent days, took questions at his news conference only from conservative news organizations and ignored more challenging questions shouted to him as he left the podium. So far, the White House has had little success in trying to shift the narrative from the Russian contacts to accusations about the leaking of sensitive information by the intelligence agencies, as well as by the F. B. I. Mr. Trump used a similar strategy during the transition, after disclosures that the intelligence agencies presented him with a dossier containing potentially compromising â€” but unsubstantiated â€” information that Russian officials had collected on him during his travels to Russia. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said on Twitter, \"The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!\" The president also praised a column by Eli Lake of Bloomberg View, which criticized the selective leaking of intercepted communications between Mr. Flynn and Mr. Kislyak. Mr. Lake went on to suggest, however, that Mr. Flynn had been sacrificed to protect other officials, potentially including the president himself. Mr. Trump, as he has before, rejected allegations that his policy toward Russia was being compromised. \"Crimea was TAKEN by Russia during the Obama Administration. Was Obama too soft on Russia?\" he posted on Twitter.',\n",
              " 'French President Emmanuel Macron s government announced reforms to loosen labor regulations and drive down unemployment, drawing criticism from unions but limited support for the street protests that have hindered previous reform bids. After weeks of negotiations with unions over the summer, the centrist government revealed measures including a cap on payouts for dismissals adjudged unfair and greater freedom to hire and fire. The plan would also give companies more flexibility to adapt pay and working hours to market conditions. The labor code reform is the first big test of Macron s drive to re-shape the euro zone s second biggest economy with its near double-digit jobless rate, double that in Britain and markedly higher than Germany. He also seeks a grand bargain with Germany over broader reforms of the euro zone. For decades, governments of the left and right have tried to reform France s strict labor rules, but have always diluted them in the face of street protests. The reform makes no direct reference to France s 35-hour week but gives employers more flexibility to negotiate deals with employees to work around it. Labour Minister Muriel Penicaud described the five decrees laying out the reforms as a transformation of labor rules on an unprecedented scale . Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said they were necessary to fight France s stubbornly high unemployment. The truth is that for bosses, especially of small companies, and foreign investors, the existing labor law is seen as a brake on hiring and investment, Philippe said. Trade unions were less upbeat at what they perceived as the loss of long-cherished workers rights. All of our fears have been confirmed, said Philippe Martinez, head of the hard-left CGT union, after the government presented the decrees to unions and employers. He said the union would press ahead with its plan for a protest on Sept. 12. But Macron s assiduous courting of the unions over the summer appeared to have born fruit. France s biggest union, the reformist CFDT, said it was disappointed with what amounted to a missed opportunity to improve labor relations. But both the CFDT and the smaller Force Ouvriere, one of the spearheads of last year s anti-reform protests, said they would not be joining the CGT s protest. This reform does not rise to the occasion , CFDT leader Laurent Berger told reporters, but he added: Taking to the streets is not the only mode of action for unions. It sets a cap on compensation for a dismissal judged in a labor court to be unfair. This will be set at three months of wages for two years in the company with the amount rising progressively depending on how long a worker was with the firm. In a concession to unions, normal severance pay would be increased from 20 percent of one month s wage for each year in a company to 25 percent. Economists drew parallels with Germany and Spain. This very much resembles the labor reform carried out in Germany in 2004-2005, said Florian Hense, European economist at Berenberg Bank. This could very well propel France to a golden decade like Germany had. Dutch bank ING said: The ceiling on dismissal compensation is a milestone in labor flexibility and a real positive for permanent contract creation. In Spain, a similar reform kick-started an unprecedented labor market recovery. Pierre Gattaz, the head of the MEDEF employers federation, described the reforms as an important first step which would boost confidence within companies. The CPME, a small business lobby, was even more positive. At last!, it said in a statement. After months of negotiations, we got results. The reform we had been waiting for so long is there. The labor reforms comes as the 39-year-old president suffers a steep drop in popularity ratings. Early policy announcements including an overhaul of the wealth tax and cuts to housing assistance have left a swathe of voters feeling his policies favor the rich, pollsters say. The government plans to start talks on overhauling unemployment benefits in October before tackling pension reform next year. Parliament, where Macron s Republic on the Move party has a commanding majority, has already voted to allow the government to issue the decrees without a vote in the assembly. The government plans to adopt the decrees on Sept. 22.',\n",
              " 'Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton on Wednesday proposed a temporary freeze on some student debt and the cutting of college tuition entirely for some families, focusing on an issue important to supporters of her rival Bernie Sanders. Clinton\\'s latest proposal includes a three-month moratorium for federal student loan payments and a new measure to eliminate in-state college tuition for families whose income does not exceed $125,000, according to a release from her campaign. The proposal builds on her earlier plan for easing student debt loads for higher education. Clinton, the former secretary of state and presumptive Democratic Party nominee, is looking to win over supporters of Sanders, the Vermont senator who was her main opponent for the nomination as he consistently sought to push the party left. The presumptive Republican nominee, businessman Donald Trump, also has courted Sanders\\' voters, trying to use his outsider appeal to bring them over to his campaign. On Wednesday, Clinton proposed using executive action to offer a three-month moratorium on student loan payments to all federal loan borrowers to offer help for borrowers to consolidate loans and find other methods to reduce their payments. She previously has released proposals to increase access to tuition grants, push for income-based repayments, and - like Sanders - to allow graduates to refinance student loans at lower interest rates. Sanders praised the new Clinton measures on Wednesday, saying in a statement that he wanted \"to take this opportunity to applaud Secretary Clinton.\"',\n",
              " 'The sad fact is my hair, like many women, is thinning and becoming more delicate as I get older. This is an issue in part because I like it at a below-shoulder length (just keeps so many options open for how to wear it). I have been looking for a shampoo and conditioner that will help my hair be healthier and appear a bit more full. Toward this goal I had been using for decades, but they changed the formula and now it is terrible. I came across Biolage Fortetherapie Strengthening Conditioner while searching for a good replacement for my old-formula conditioner and (which had a scent I didn\\'t like and led to a strange incident covered in that review). I replaced the shampoo with which seems a set with Fortetherapie conditioner. I\\'ve tried several other conditioners that were not really satisfactory and some just not acceptable. Fortetherapie was like a breath of fresh air and left my hair feeling very nice. The scent is very mild and sort of like bamboo. It is almost no scent which pleases me. With my below shoulder hair I used dollop about between the size of a nickel and a quarter then rub my hands together and work it throughout my hair. This amount seems to work well and helps make it easier to get my shower comb through my wet hair. It\\'s not really a detangling conditioner for me, but it helps a lot and that is plenty good for me. Rinsing it out takes longer than I expected. Hotter water helps clear it faster but too-hot may not be good for hair or scalp. I\\'m slowly trying to use less and less till I hit the right balance. The bottom line is using and Fortetherapie Strenthening conditioner is leaving my hair and scalp feeling and looking better than I expected. My hair looks and feels clean longer and is very manageable. I\\'ll update the review with observations about the \"strengthening\" properties as I live with Fortetherapie conditioner longer. First impressions are very positive and hopeful. I hope this will be helpful, especially for those of us who loved the original formula Nexxus Humectress conditioner. Update: Jan 9 2014 Because of the rinsing issue I mentioned in the main review I have been using less and less of the Biolage conditioner each shampoo. I\\'m now using about half what I started with and it rinses easier and my hair looks and feels at least as nice. What I\\'m using now seems less than what I would have thought would be effective. But happy surprise: it\\'s like getting twice as many shampoos for the same money. It seems like my Biolage conditioner keeps getting better and better. Update: Feb 15 2015 I think I\\'m using a little less than in the January update. A little less than a rounded nickel sized blob. This seems about right for my below shoulder length hair. I also can risse this amount more easily without resorting to very hot water. After a couple of months I feel my hair is either stronger or less likely to tangle and break. Whatever the case I got the same positive result. Matrix Biolage Strengthening conditioner exceeds my original expectation even more now.',\n",

              " 'Europe\\'s Battle: Nationalists vs. Elites October 26, 2016  On both sides of the Atlantic, a battle is underway between largely discredited \"elites\" and sometimes disreputable \"nationalists,\" a conflict over un-kept promises about the future and unsettling memories of the past, writes Andrew Spannaus.  By Andrew Spannaus  In recent years \"nationalism\" has become a bad word in Europe, a synonym of closure, racism and wars. Over the past 20-25 years European elites have instead embraced a concept of globalization based on a world without economic, physical and social borders.  This view assumes the gradual affirmation of a set of shared values internationally, consisting of human rights and economic freedom, that however much the remaining closed, autocratic regimes may try, will inevitably become the standard for the entire world. Flag of the European Union.  It is essentially the argument put forward by Francis Fukuyama in \"The End of History:\" liberal democracy and free markets have won the ideological war, and represent the culmination of human evolution.  The political events of 2016 are upending this view of the globalization of human rights and economic liberalism. The American electorate has supported a series of outsiders â€“ most notably Donald Trump, who has run his campaign in direct opposition to the U.S. political and financial class, invoking economic protectionism and a stronger national identity.  Against expectations, the population of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, marking an irreparable break in the supposedly inevitable process of European unification. And across Europe support is growing for more extreme, anti-system political forces, that threaten not only to withdraw from the common currency â€“ the Euro â€“ but also to seal the borders in response to economic and security threats associated with immigration.  Establishment\\'s Failure  It is no exaggeration to speak of the failure of the entire transatlantic political establishment. Since the 1970s, Western economies have undergone a post-industrial transformation that has favored short-term gain over long-term investment. The notion of economic freedom has translated principally into support for deregulation and speculative finance. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is welcomed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the Federal Chancellery in Berlin, Germany, on April 14, 2011. [State Department photo/ Public Domain Central Banks have made unlimited resources available to the financial sector while large areas of the real economy struggle to survive, feeding discontent among the population. It is true that new economic sectors have arisen, along with widespread changes made possible by technologies that were inconceivable until a few years ago, but the overall effect has been to hollow out the middle class and create large-scale income equality. In Europe, the principal vehicle of this process has been the economic policy of the European Union. From the implementation of the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, European nations have been stuck in a monetary straitjacket, that prevents governments from taking effective economic action. In the name of market principles, liberalization has been implemented that favors large financial interests while lowering standards of living for the middle class.  Countries are constitutionally required to move towards a balanced budget, with the European Commission and the European Central Bank essentially having veto power over national policies. This has translated into harsh austerity, including the massive budget cuts and tax increases inflicted on countries such as Greece, Spain and Italy in recent years.  Despite paying lip service to the need for change, the economic and political elites have refused to abandon this approach, that not only ignores the suffering of the population, but actually makes the problem worse. In fact the austerity causes a drop in economy activity and thus exacerbates budget problems, leading to a vicious cycle that Europe seems unable to stop.  A Big Backlash  The resulting backlash is calling into question the process of European integration as a whole, provoking a strenuous defense by the elite of institutions that are said to have guaranteed \"50 years of peace\" after the Second World War. The run-down PIX Theatre sign reads \"Vote Trump\" on Main Street in Sleepy Eye, Minnesota. July 15, 2016. (Photo by Tony Webster Flickr)  It is true, of course, that there are some benefits to E.U. integration, and that nobody wants to return to a situation of conflict among the member states. But the current policies are quite different than the fruitful cooperation that existed until the 1990s, when the financial elite began its move to exert supranational control.  Now, the failed economic policies of the past 20 years are no longer sustainable. Governments are forced to negotiate over .1 percent of the budget deficit with the bureaucracy in Brussels, while the need for public and private investment runs in the trillions.  The pro-finance, anti-production policies must change not for ideological reasons or to serve some specific interest group; they must change because there is no other choice. People are revolting against a political class that does not respond adequately to widespread economic and social discontent. In times of economic distress the population becomes more vulnerable to demagogues, raising the risk of dangerous outcomes, as seen with Fascism and Nazism in the 1920s and 1930s.  Currently, there are unprepared and unpredictable political forces with growing support across Europe, that in some cases represent a threat to the democratic rights and values that the European Union aims to promote. Defending the orthodoxy of E.U. policy against popular movements that target failed economic policies, will only further damage precisely those values on which Europe is said to stand.  What to Do  At this point Europe needs a return to measures that promote productive investment and innovation, rather than cut social welfare programs and encourage further deregulation. Refugees from Mideast wars camped along rail lines in Greece.  There are two potential directions: a wholesale change in the policies of the E.U. institutions, without modifying their essential structure, or a step back from the process of cancellation of national sovereignty.  The first option seems unrealistic, for various reasons. These include the constitutional nature of many economic and budget constraints, and the stubbornness demonstrated by the European ruling class in recent years; a class that, despite numerous alarm bells, does not at all seem ready to abandon an elitist view of globalization.  The response to the Brexit vote is a glaring example. Representatives of the E.U. institutions lashed out with arrogance and bitterness, essentially accusing half of the British population of being ignorant, racist and isolationist. It\\'s a comforting excuse based on partial truths, that avoids reflection on Europe\\'s own mistakes.  At this point a return of decision-making power to national governments is becoming inevitable: not in order to stop international cooperation, or to reject shared values, but because the model pursued by the supranational institutions and their allies in the financial world has failed, and risks producing both serious internal conflicts, and unacceptable strategic failures in an increasingly complex world.

              " 'The Clinton campaign reacted with yet another ad featuring Trump\\'s own words this time disparaging veterans and their families. The anti-Trump Priorities USA SuperPAC went even further with a new spot that shows Trump saying, \"I love war.\" Trump\\'s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway responded by saying the bizarre comment was taken out of context but the full quote, which he gave last November at a wild Fort Dodge, Iowa, rally (the same one where he called Ben Carson a child molester), is even worse than what it sounds like in the ad: Trump has never been in the service, although he has said,\"I always felt I was in the military\" because of his education at a military-themed boarding school and he believes he has \"more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military.\" That comment \"I\\'m good at war\" says everything about Trump as he demonstrated last night at the town hall forum that he is indeed unfit to be president of the United States. There were many aspects of his performance that had people gasping at the mere idea of this man in a position of real power, not the least of which was his comment that President Barack Obama compares unfavorably to Russian President Vladimir Putin who \"has an 85 percent approval rating\" and is \"very much a leader\" because he has \"strong control over his country.\" But it was around the question of ISIS and the Middle East where he really showed his true colors. He was upset that Hillary Clinton had earlier claimed that he had lied when he said he had been against the Iraq War and defended himself by pointing to an Esquire magazine article from 2004 â€” which doesn\\'t really help since the war began in the spring of 2003. The fact-checkers have declared his pants are on fire numerous times on this but he just keeps saying it. Last night he also made a passing reference to someone \"asking him about Iraq\" 14 years ago, and you may be surprised to learn that at that same crazy Iowa rally he told the crowd that a delegation from the White House came to him to ask his opinion and he advised not to go in because it would destabilize the region. To the best of my knowledge this claim has never been validated. It\\'s possible, of course, this was the Bush administration. But let\\'s just say that it\\'s as likely as Trump\\'s witnessing thousands of New Jersey Muslims cheering after 9/11. You\\'ll knock the hell out of one and the other one is going to come and take over the other. You don\\'t have to be a genius to figure this out even though I am a genius. And by the way, I\\'m more militaristic than anybody in this room. I\\'m going to make our military so strong, so powerful. Everyone seems to think that Trump has \"pivoted\" from his position that he could not reveal his plan to defeat ISIS to his announcement today that he would give the generals 30 days from the inauguration to come up with one. But that\\'s wrong. Trump\\'s secret plan is not so secret. At that same rally last fall, Trump spoke about it plainly: \"I know more about ISIS than the generals do. Believe me. . . . I would bomb the shit out of \\'em. . . . I\\'d blow up the pipes. I\\'d blow up the â€” I\\'d blow up every single inch. There would be nothing left. And you know what, you get Exxon to come in there and in two months â€” you ever see these guys how good they are? The great oil companies? They\\'ll rebuild that sucker brand-new. It\\'ll be beautiful. And I\\'d bring it, and I\\'d take the oil.\" At the forum, he reiterated this belief that America should \"take the oil\" because he thinks this will make ISIS surrender and has taken to saying \"to the victor goes the spoils\" apparently unaware that this is a considered a war crime. He has said in the past it would require a permanent force to protect the oil but that it wouldn\\'t take much. Trump said that under Obama and Clinton\\'s leadership \"the generals have been reduced to rubble\" and \"reduced to a point where it\\'s embarrassing for our country.\" He sounded as if he planned to fire some of them, which isn\\'t actually something the president can do. As he is wont to do he brought up his favorite, General George Patton, saying that he\\'s \"spinning in his grave\" over the state of affairs in the military. The good news is that he didn\\'t bring up General Black Jack Pershing and endorse mass executions with bullets dipped in pigs\\' blood as he often does on the trail. He maintained that he still believes in his own plan for Iraq and says he won\\'t necessarily follow the generals\\' advice. So, the GOP nominee for commander in chief tells people that he\\'s \"good at war,\" \"has had a lot of wars of his own\" and \"loves war in a certain way\" despite never having been in the military. He also believes he\\'s a \"genius\" who is \"more militaristic\" than anyone in the room. His plan to defeat ISIS is to blow up the Iraqi oil wells and have Exxon come in and rebuild them. And he believes that half the military leadership are fools and thinks he can just fire the ones he doesn\\'t like. But there\\'s nothing delusional about any of that so there\\'s no need to concern yourselves that the poll numbers are tightening. If he happens to pull this off, what could go wrong?',\n",

              " 'The U.S. power sector\\'s shift toward burning less coal and using more natural gas and renewable energy will not be derailed by the Supreme Court ruling against the Obama administration\\'s limits on carbon emissions, state regulators and utilities said on Wednesday. The U.S. Supreme Court decided 5-4 on Tuesday to block the Environmental Protection Agency\\'s carbon emissions crackdown on coal plants until a legal challenge is resolved. Some states may now slow work on compliance with the EPA\\'s Clean Power Plan. But some experts said they were confident the rule will survive the legal challenge when the D.C. circuit court makes a decision this summer. \"In a way we are really just postponing the inevitable,\" said Vicki Arroyo, executive director of the Georgetown Climate Center. Even in some of the 27 states that sued to block the rule, officials had been working on compliance plans. Most states said they will continue to decarbonize their energy supply. Utilities across the country have already begun a major shift away from coal-fired electricity toward cleaner burning and cheaper natural gas and renewables like wind and solar. \"We fully expect that many of these states will continue their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under their own legal authorities,\" said Bill Becker, director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies. States like California, Colorado and New York criticized the high court\\'s decision and vowed to pursue their plans to shift to cleaner energy regardless of the delay in the EPA rule. Meanwhile, states like Montana and North Dakota that joined in the lawsuit against the EPA welcomed the \"breathing room\" the stay provides. But even these opponents of the rule said they will keep diversifying their power supply. Colorado\\'s Democratic Governor John Hickenlooper said the state will keep working on compliance so it \"is not left at a disadvantage if the courts uphold all or part of the Clean Power Plan.\" Colorado challenged the EPA plan even though the governor supports it. The state\\'s Republican attorney general disagrees about the legality of the rule and its economic impact. Montana Governor Steve Bullock, a Democrat, opposed the EPA rule. He said the state would put on hold the work of a group to devise compliance options, but added that it still needs \"to address climate change and embrace Montana\\'s energy future.\" He said: \"I am committed to ensuring we do so on our own terms.\" For coal-producing North Dakota, which had one of the highest emission reduction targets to meet under the rule, regulators and utilities will keep working on ways to lower power plant emissions, said state health department chief Dave Glatt. He said the EPA plan did not give the state \"a sufficient amount of time to have reasonable solutions.\" He pledged to \"look at reasonable steps forward.\" For most states, coal-fired electricity has been in decline. In 2015, generators shut over 15,000 megawatts of coal-fired power plants, the most in any year, as low gas prices drove down power costs. It became uneconomical to overhaul older coal plants even to meet existing federal clean air rules. Ohio regulators said Wednesday they were not sure how the state will respond to the court decision, but the state\\'s major utilities are already shifting away from coal. American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP.N) will continue generating more power with natural gas and renewable energy since prices for those have dropped significantly, said spokeswoman Melissa McHenry. She added that the five-year extension of federal renewable energy tax credits has given AEP an incentive to bring more renewable energy into the mix. \"It makes sense that we are sticking to our current plans, and will be positioned to respond to the courts\\' ultimate decision on the future of the Clean Power Plan,\" she said. Another Ohio utility, FirstEnergy Corp (FE.N), said it already retired a number of older coal plants in 2012. The court decision will have little impact. \"The Supreme Court decision does not change the path we are on,\" said spokeswoman Jennifer Young. \"We think it is the right thing to do â€“ this is a complicated issue and this decision will give the states the appropriate amount of time to develop their compliance plans.\"',\n",

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/the-four-reasons-for-assassination-of.html For me, this case is closed. John F. Kennedy was assassinated for stripping the Rothschild-owned Federal Reserve of its power to print and loan money to the United States Federal Government at interest. President Kennedy signed Executive Order No. 11110 on June 4, 1963, which returned to the U.S. government the power to issue currency, without going through the privately-owned Federal Reserve . Unknowingly, he also signed his death sentence that day. President Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963 and the United States Notes (backed by silver) he had issued were immediately taken out of circulation. Federal Reserve Notes continued to serve as the legal currency of the nation. You can read everything on the subject by following this link .But, it\\'s likely that at least three other factors have played a role in the decision to assassinate him and, later, other members of his family . 2. Not long before his death, President Kennedy famously stated: \"I will splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it into the winds.\" It is known that JFK fired CIA Director Allen Dulles and this book claims the latter is responsible for ordering the hit on the US President. 3. In a famous speech, JFK exposed the network of secret societies that operate against the American people and publicly opposed their devious ways of undermining mankind\\'s freedom. Just two years before he was assassinated (1961), JFK gave a really chilling â€” yet inspiring â€” speech, exposing secret societies. The warning is especially powerful because it came from a President in office: For me, this speech is remarkable especially because the Kennedys were part of the 13 \"elite\" families that rule the Earth from the shadows. These three facts are clearly showing that JFK declared war against the shadow \"elite\" and their network of secret societies. And for this reason, he and many other members of his lineage have paid the ultimate price . But he was not the only US President who gave us this warning: Former US Presidents and High Officials Warn About the \\'Invisible Government\\' Running the USA 4. Lastly, just ten days before his assassination, JFK asked for access to the UFO files. Based on evidence , the plot for JFK\\'s assassination was already set in motion when he asked to access the UFO files. In fact, new evidence suggests that Lee Harvey Oswald worked directly for Robert F. Kennedy and â€” shockingly â€” helped save JFK from an \\'assassination plot\\' three weeks earlier in Chicago . But, in so doing, he sealed his own fate. You can read more on the subject by accessing this link . But, even though JFK was already marked for assassination, demanding access to the UFO files could have expedited the efforts to take him out before he could succeed. The following article, wrote by Makia Freeman , makes a very strong case in support of this idea. Was JFK murdered mostly because he was trying to gain access to classified information on UFOs, ETs and aliens? As we approach the 53rd anniversary of the JFK assassination (which occurred on November 22, 1963) and mark the death of the greatest US president ever to challenge the New World Order Secret Government, it is worth briefly looking back in time to realize the tremendous lessons from the Kennedy murder. Last year in 2015 I released an in-depth 3-part series on the JFK assassination, dealing with the Who , How and Why of the event, which was a sacrificial mass ritual designed (among other things) to traumatize the American public. In part 3 I compiled a list of the various motives certain people and groups had to kill Kennedy. JFK had crossed the CIA, the Nazis, the Zionists, the Military Industrial Complex, the Federal Reserve and the Mafia â€“ all the while not being part of Secret Society Freemasonic brotherhood. However, was the ultimate reason he was killed due to his persistence and demands in obtaining top secret intelligence on the alien matter? Was JFK murdered because he challenged the power of Majestic-12 or MJ-12, the hidden group Truman had created to be the keepers of UFO and alien secrets? There is substantial evidence to indicate this is indeed the case. Released JFK Letters to CIA and NASA Show His Demand for UFO Files â€“ 10 Days Before His Death Two memos authored by Kennedy were released to researcher William Lester under FOIA (Freedom of Information Act). Both were written on November 12, 1963, just 10 days before JFK was murdered. One of them is a letter (pictured below) to CIA Director John McCone, who succeeded CIA Director Allen Dulles, one of the JFK assassination conspirators and masterminds (see part 1 ). In the memorandum with the subject \"Classification review of all UFO intelligent files affecting National Security\", JFK explicitly writes that he has initiated a joint space program with the USSR. He is telling the CIA that he wants to share its UFO, ET and alien data with NASA, and wants to distinguish between knowns and unknowns (we can interpret the \"knowns\" as US controlled secret technology such as anti-gravity craft and the \"unknowns\" as genuine extraterrestrial phenomena). Here is the text: \"As I had discussed with you previously, I have initiated [redacted] have instructed James Webb to develop a program with the Soviet Union in joint space and inner exploration. \"It would be very helpful if you would have the high threat cases reviewed with the purpose of identification of bona fide as opposed to classified CIA and USAF sources. \"It is important that we make a clear distinction between the knowns and unknowns in the event the Soviets try to mistake our extended cooperation as a cover for intelligence gathering of their defense and space programs. \"When this data has been sorted out, I would like you to arrange a program of data sharing with NASA where Unknowns are a factor. This will help NASA mission directors in their defensive responsibilities. \"I would like an interim report on the data review no later than February 1, 1964.\" The other memorandum (National Security Action Memorandum No. 271, pictured below) is addressed to then NASA administrator James Webb. It carries the subject line of \"Cooperation with the USSR on Outer Space Matters\". JFK outlines how he wants NASA to develop a program of cooperation with the Russians in the field of outer space. JFK Murdered Over UFO Intelligence Access â€“ The Bigger Picture However, to put these two memos in context, you need to understand that Kennedy had been chasing the golden goose for a long time. Authors and experts such as Dr. Michael Salla, Richard Hoagland and Mike Bara, some of whose work you can read here in \" President Kennedy\\'s deadly confrontation with the CIA & MJ-12 over ET/UFO X-Files â€“ Part II \", have done extensive research to show that JFK was determined, before his presidency even began, to get full UFO intelligence access and as president re-take control of the information. He wanted it out of military, unelected hands and placed back into civilian, elected ones. He was out to undo the damage Truman had done, and Eisenhower had continued, by setting up the hidden MJ-12 group in 1947 and keeping the UFO and alien subject under wraps as a giant secret. The following is from a review or synopsis of Salla\\'s book Kennedy\\'s Last Stand: Eisenhower, UFOs, MJ-12 and JFK\\'s Assassination : \"In searching for answers to who killed President Kennedy we need to start with the death of his mentor, James Forrestal in 1949. Forrestal became the first Secretary of Defense in 1947, a position he held until March, 1949. \"Forrestal was a visionary who thought Americans had a right to know about the existence of extraterrestrial life and technologies. \"Forrestal was sacked by President Truman because he was revealing the truth to various officials, including Kennedy who was a Congressman at the time. Forrestal\\'s ideals and vision inspired Kennedy, and laid the seed for what would happen 12 years later. \"After winning the 1960 Presidential election, Kennedy learned a shocking truth from President Eisenhower. The control group set up to run highly classified extraterrestrial technologies, Majestic-12, had become a rogue government agency. \"Eisenhower warned Kennedy that Majestic-12 had to be reined in. It posed a direct threat to American liberties and democratic processes. Kennedy followed Eisenhower\\'s advice, and set out to realize James Forrestal\\'s vision. \"The same forces that orchestrated Forrestal\\'s death, opposed Kennedy\\'s efforts at every turn. When Kennedy was on the verge of succeeding, by forcing the CIA to share classified UFO information with other government agencies on November 12, 1963, he was assassinated ten days later.\" Joint US-USSR Space Missions: JFK Murdered Over Clever Strategy Although JFK surely and naturally had other reasons for wanting to work together with the Soviets (and thus avoid any possibility of a nuclear war), it is quite possible that his proposed joint US-USSR program was an excuse and a clever means to wrest control of the ET issue from the hands of MJ-12. To have NASA cooperate with the Soviet space administration on lunar missions and outer space exploration would necessarily mean sharing data on UFOs. After all, the existence (and extreme technological capacity) of such craft were an obvious security factor and threat that would impact any space expedition. Kennedy already had Soviet leader Nikita Kruschchev on board. Salla writes : \"Documents confirm that on November 12, 1963 Kennedy and Khrushchev had agreed on steps to share UFO information precisely for this reason, and Kennedy identified the CIA as the lead U.S. agency to implement the process. \"Unknown to Kennedy, the CIA\\'s chief of counterintelligence, Angleton, implemented a secret set of directives that would deny access to classified UFO information to Kennedy, his national security staff and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\" The \"burned memo\" or MJ-12 Kennedy assassination directive The MJ-12 Kennedy Assassination Directive Truth is heavily guarded by layers of secrecy, deception, falsehood and propaganda. Often, government officials hide the truth by overseeing partial disclosures which are carefully orchestrated to give away just enough of the secret without going in too deep. Ever since the Roswell crash of 1947, the US Government kept 2 sets of UFO files. The tamer cases and less controversial information were made publicly available through Project Blue Book, which was the official public investigation into UFOs by the USAF. It formally ended in 1970. However, the really good stuff with high classifications was kept under lock and key by the CIA and MJ-12. Kennedy must have learnt enough about the situation to have known this, and have slowly but surely been making his way to the source of the information. By the time it got to November 12th, 1963, it was the final straw; MJ-12 who controlled the CIA would not allow Kennedy to have UFO intelligence access â€“ at any cost. As mentioned in part 3, the Kennedy assassination directive (pictured above) was written in code language to disguise the hit they were ordering. It uses the Russian spy term \"wet\" (i.e. wet from being drenched in fresh blood) to mean a killing. The memo reads:\"when conditions become nonconductive for growth in our environment and Washington cannot be influenced any further... it should be \\'wet.\\'\" This is from Salla\\'s commentary: \"Dr Robert Wood who is the foremost expert in analyzing MJ-12 documents using forensic methods, has concluded that the burned document is an assassination directive... he pointed out that the cryptic phrase \"it should be wet\" originates from Russia, where the phrase \\'wet works\\' or \"wet affairs\" denotes someone who had been killed and is drenched with blood. The codeword \\'wet\\' was later adopted by the Soviet KGB and other intelligence agencies... In drafting this cryptic directive, Allen Dulles was seeking approval from six of his MJ-12 colleagues, to lay the justification for the assassination of any elected or appointed official in Washington DC whose policies were \"non-conducive for growth\". The cryptic directive was a pre-authorization for the assassination of any U.S. President who could not \"be influenced any further\" to follow MJ-12 policies.\" CIA Wiretap of Marilyn Monroe Also Suggests JFK Murdered Over UFO Issue Popular actress Marilyn Monroe was a famous lover of both JFK and his brother Robert, who served as Attorney General in the Kennedy Administration. In April 2014, evidence came to light in the form of an alleged CIA transcription (pictured below). If real â€“ and it appears genuine â€“ it shows that the CIA were wiretapping Monroe and knew she was about to go public and blow the whistle on JFK and UFOs. Here is what the alleged CIA wiretap document (dated August 3, 1962) states: \"Rothberg indicated in so many words, that she [Monroe] had secrets to tell, no doubt arising from her trists [sic] with the President and the Attorney General. \"One such \"secret\" mentions the visit by the President at a secret air base for the purpose of inspecting things from outer space. 2. Subject repeatedly called the Attorney General and complained about the way she was being ignored by the President and his brother. 3. Subject threatened to hold a press conference and would tell all.\" CIA wiretap of Marilyn Monroe: more proof JFK murdered due to UFOs and aliens? Robert Kennedy Also Briefed On UFOs Another piece of evidence substantiating the \"JFK murdered due to UFOs\" hypothesis is that his brother and Attorney General Robert Kennedy was also briefed on the matter. Lieutenant Colonel Philip Corso, a man who served in a number of National Security Council committees from 1953-57 during the Eisenhower presidency, says Bobby actually sought him out. In this short video Corso says he personally briefed Bobby Kennedy on the subject of flying saucers or UFOs. Bobby was JFK\\'s closest advisor. Conclusion: Highly Likely JFK Murdered Over UFOs and ETs / Aliens So at the end of the day was JFK murdered over the UFOs and aliens? While there were many motives for (and conspirators involved in) the killing of JFK, the evidence is overwhelming that his demand for more control over the UFO and alien subject was the crucial factor in the decision by MJ-12 to assassinate him. It may have been the straw that broke the camel\\'s back, but more likely it was the central issue all along. JFK inherited a system from Eisenhower and Truman, US presidents who had already given away substantial control to the Military Industrial Intelligence Complex. Indeed, the very term \"Military Industrial Complex\" (MIC) has only become so commonplace thanks to Eisenhower using it in his farewell speech , where he issued a grave warning to the American public about the power that the MIC already held (but which he also allowed to a large extent). To study the New World Order and the worldwide conspiracy at the deepest levels is to study the UFO, ET and alien agenda. To study UFOs and aliens, in turn, is to accept the existence of free energy technology (aka zero point or over unity energy). This is the gamechanger . Once people accept the reality of free energy and learn how to create and share it, the control grid and conspiracy will evaporate â€“ because knowledgeable and abundant people cannot be controlled. There is so much at stake at here! Thank you JFK and to all others who have dedicated their lives to making this information public, widespread and accessible ! The truth cannot be hidden forever.

              " 'As the Islamic State seeks to export its brand of barbaric terror to would-be affiliates, the U.S. faces a growing challenge to find the sources of ISIS funding and blunt its flow to allied militants. The terror army\\'s most recent atrocity was the mass beheading of 21 Coptic Christians in Libya. It remains unclear how closely tied those militants are to ISIS in Iraq and Syria, but the Islamic State\\'s underground economy continues to thrive. Even as the U.S.-led coalition strikes at what was long the heart of ISIS\\' revenue stream -- oil fields and refineries -- officials say the terror network is making money in other ways. \"We know that oil revenue is no longer the lead source of their income in dollars,\" Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said recently. But he added: \"They get a lot of donations. They also have a significant black market program.\" How much money ISIS truly makes from donations is a matter of debate. But experts agree that ISIS receives significant revenue from black-market smuggling and other operations. \"ISIS is selling anything they can get their hands on,\" Dr. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said in an interview with Fox News. Plus, according to reports, the group is even skimming Iraqi taxpayer dollars by shaking down government employees in areas they\\'ve conquered. In short, ISIS is set on building a terror empire, going so far as to tout its annual financials. Reportedly, ISIS released a $2 billion budget for 2015 including a $250 million surplus, though those numbers are disputed. After Mosul fell to the Islamic State in June, the International Business Times declared ISIS the \"world\\'s richest terrorist organization\" after the central bank\\'s vaults were looted of some $420 million. Estimates vary, but ISIS reportedly rakes in between one and three million dollars per day, though the strikes against its oil refineries have taken a toll. The United Nations last Thursday tried to strike at the money stream. The Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution aimed at cutting off millions of dollars in earnings from oil smuggling, antiquities trafficking and ransom payments to ISIS. The measure calls for sanctions against individuals and entities that trade in oil with ISIS and Al Qaeda affiliates such as the Al-Nusra Front in Syria. The resolution was co-sponsored by more than 35 countries. It called for all 193 countries of the U.N. to take steps to prevent ancient artifacts from being smuggled and sold and to ban the direct or indirect sale of ransoms. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said payments and donations to ISIS \"perpetuate a cycle of horrific brutality, giving these groups resources to carry out more murderous acts and incentivizing them to take more people captive.\" How much ISIS really receives from donations is unclear. \"Most charities [supporting radical Islam] in the Gulf are aligned with Al Qaeda, not ISIS,\" said Gartenstein-Ross. Gartenstein-Ross pointed to Abdulrahman al-Nuaymi, a Qatari who has been accused by the U.S. Treasury Department of transferring millions of dollars to Al Qaeda affiliates in Iraq and Syria, as a prime example of this arrangement. While many blame Qatar for playing a \"double game\" of supporting both radical Islamist groups and the coalition against ISIS, the Obama administration disputes the notion that wealthy Arabs from Persian Gulf countries give generously to ISIS. \"ISIL derives a relatively small share of its funds from deep-pocket donors, and thus does not, today, depend principally on moving money across international borders. Instead, ISIL obtains the vast majority of its revenues through local criminal and terrorist activities,\" said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen in October, at The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"There is a lot of opacity,\" Gartenstein-Ross admitted. But he said the smuggling of black market goods, similar to the opium trade by the Taliban inside Afghanistan; taxation among the Iraqi population particularly in Mosul; and the sale of oil round out other areas of ISIS funding. Gartenstein-Ross pointed out that airstrikes from the U.S.-led coalition against oil refineries in Syria have denied ISIS a large source of revenue. Looting and ransoms make up for some of the difference, however. Some experts point to the Iraqi government as unwittingly contributing to ISIS\\' coffers. Aki Peritz, a former CIA counterterrorism analyst, said in a recent New York Times op-ed that the Iraqi government continues to pay its civil servants in Mosul, despite being controlled by ISIS. Peritz wrote, \"Baghdad provides about $130 million every month to pay all its workers in Mosul\" and estimated that Iraq\\'s treasury has paid over $1 billion to these civil servants since Mosul fell in June 2014. He estimated that ISIS has taken half of those payments in the form of taxation. While efforts are currently underway to dismantle key revenue sources for the Islamic State, there are signs the caliphate is receiving setbacks from within. According to syriadirect.org, \"Assassinations, bombings and defections plague the Islamic State in Deir e-Zor,\" in oil-rich eastern Syria. The nonprofit news outlet based in Amman, Jordan, says that over the past month, assassination attempts against members of ISIS religious police have become more common.

              " 'U.S. President Donald Trump has re-tweeted anti-Islam videos originally posted by Jayda Fransen, a leader of a far-right British party convicted earlier in November of abusing a Muslim woman. Fransen is deputy leader of the anti-immigrant Britain First group. Here are some details about her organization: Britain First was founded in 2011 by leader Paul Golding with a membership of three individuals. It describes itself as a patriotic political party and street movement , although critics denounce it as a far-right, racist organization. Britain First is committed to preserving our ancestral ethnic and cultural heritage, traditions, customs and values, it says on its website. It wants to deport all illegal immigrants, halt all further immigration, and introduce a comprehensive ban on the religion of Islam with headscarves being outlawed in public. Anyone found to be promoting the ideology of Islam will be subject to deportation or imprisonment, its policy platform states. It holds protests across the country, usually attended by a couple of hundred supporters at most, many of whom hold white crosses because the group argues Christianity in Britain is being threatened by immigration and the growth of militant Islam. Golding was a former senior figure in the far-right British National Party and was elected a local councillor in 2009. In his biography on the group s website it says he was sent to prison in 2016 for confronting a Muslim hate preacher who was secretly recorded saying it s okay for Muslims to keep sex slaves . Golding stood for election as London mayor in May 2016, winning 31,372 votes, 1.2 percent of all cast. Fransen, who was elected deputy leader in 2014, was convicted of religiously aggravated harassment in November 2017, and both she and Golding are facing further similar charges. The group gained prominence in June 2016 when Labour lawmaker Jo Cox was shot dead on the street by a Nazi-obsessed loner who witnesses said had been shouting Britain first during the attack. Fransen told Reuters the killer had nothing to do with her group.',\n",

              " \"WINDTALKERS is a good WWII movies filmed over the past few years in that brings attention to these uniquely qualified men of war to draw upon their heritage in this time of global conflict. It is a multi-layered and multi-faceted tale told visually through incredible images enhanced with armor piercing sound effects. The dialogue really has to take a back seat to this simple tale of men and their survival because the images of the land, the bleak faces and the carnage tell it all. This film is named WINDTALKERS but the film does not really focus on the code developed by the Navajo Marines. Director Raoul Walsh had peripherally addressed the Navajo code in 1955 with his film BATTLE CRY with Felix Noriego as Marine Crazy Horse where we saw Japanese operators baffled while listening in on radio and field-telephone transmissions. Director John Woo, as did Raoul Walsh, decides to focus his attention on the men and their diverse backgrounds and what makes them Marines. However, Woo narrows his focus on the relationship between a war-weary, shell-shocked and enigmatic Marine sergeant (Nicolas Cage) and a good-natured naive Navajo recruit (Adam Beach) assigned to him. Beach can't understand the actions or behavior of loner Cage's intensity for killing and bloodshed but learns eventually that if you survive you then increase your chances of having your comrades around you survive as well. Woo is a director noted for action and WINDTALKERS contains some of the most frenetically staged sequences ever filmed. These sequences reminded me of some of Sam Peckinpah's cathartic work from THE WILD BUNCH, the montages of the combat maelstrom of his CROSS OF IRON and the intensity of the intimate fighting of combatants from Edward Zwick's Civil War epic GLORY. This is not action for the sake of action that can be easily labeled on John Woo. Woo is making a statement that all this carnage can be addictive yet simultaneously it usually creates and strengthens intimate camaraderie. But you really can never afford to be close to any of your buddies and this is a highly moral conflict. Is battle weary hardness a symptom or a mechanism to survive? This is the price of defending the ideals that we hold so dear. This is a very subtle and great film that can be easily glossed right over for its true meaning and realization. WINDTALKERS draws attention to forgotten heroes.\",\n",

              " 'Dressed in a thick jacket and wool hat on a cool winter evening, counting the coins for his bus fare, Hedi Hammami looks like any other Tunisian on his way to work. But he walks with a limp and sometimes pauses midspeech and screws up his face in pain. \"That\\'s GuantÃ¡namo,\" he explains. After eight years as a detainee in the United States detention facility in GuantÃ¡namo Bay, Cuba, he says he still suffers from headaches, depression and anxiety attacks from the torture and other mistreatment he says he suffered there, even six years after his release. Married with two children now and employed as a nighttime ambulance driver, Mr. Hammami, 47, seems to have rebuilt his life. Yet the pressures of living in Tunisia\\'s faltering democracy, under harassment and enduring repeated raids by the police, have driven him to make an extreme request. \"It would be better for me to go back to that single cell and to be left alone,\" he said recently. \"Two or three weeks ago I went to the Red Cross and asked them to connect me to the U. S. foreign ministry to ask to go back to GuantÃ¡namo. \" The Red Cross refused to take his request, he said, but he insists nevertheless that at this point, that would be best for him. \"I have lost my hope,\" he says. \"There is no future in this country for me. \" When he was first released from GuantÃ¡namo in 2010, Tunisia was still a dictatorship under the rule of President Zine Ben Ali and notorious for torturing prisoners, in particular Islamists. Deemed no longer a threat to the United States, Mr. Hammami was sent to the former Soviet republic of Georgia. After the popular uprising in 2011 that overthrew Mr. Ben Ali and set off the Arab Spring, Mr. Hammami negotiated his return to Tunisia. He timed it well, benefiting from a national amnesty for political prisoners and a program of compensation that gave him a job in the Ministry of Health. \"I hoped very much that after the revolution everything would get better,\" he said in one of several interviews in his rented home in a suburb of Tunis. Yet, soon after he began work in 2013, the police raided his apartment with dogs at 3 a. m. breaking the door and hauling him down to the police station. \"They made me crawl on all fours down the stairs,\" he recounted. At the police station they said they just wanted to get to know him, and let him go after 15 minutes. \"That was just the beginning. \" Since then, Mr. Hammami has lived under a constant regimen of police surveillance, raids and harassment. His cellphone and computer were confiscated. When he moved to a new house, the police followed him, turning up at all hours to question him. In December 2015 he was placed under house arrest, told he no longer had the right to work and ordered to sign in at the police station morning and evening for six weeks. He remains under \"administrative control,\" and the police enforce the order at will. He cannot travel outside Tunis. Every so often, like on Sept. 11, the police order him to sign in with them. \"I feel someone is doing it for revenge,\" he says. The police have also scared landlords from renting to him, forcing him to move six times in three years. His Algerian wife\\'s residency card was confiscated, preventing her from working to supplement his meager salary. The family is barely managing, she said, asking not to be named for fear of further police harassment. Stress and tension from the police actions have intensified the psychological problems Mr. Hammami brought with him from GuantÃ¡namo. \"I feel too much pressure,\" he said, rubbing his temples. \"All that blackness comes back. \" Rim Ben Ismail, a psychologist working for the World Organization Against Torture in Tunisia, who has counseled 12 Tunisians who were detained in GuantÃ¡namo, says Mr. Hammadi\\'s wish to return to his cell is fairly typical of the GuantÃ¡namo detainees. \"They lived with suffering, physical suffering,\" she said in an interview. \"But now there is a psychic suffering, and often they say, \\'Take me back there. \\'\" \"Because of their past they are all presumed guilty and it is unlivable for all of them and their families,\" she added. \"The families are being threatened and harassed. \" Parents in particular fear the Tunisian security forces and say they think their sons would be safer in GuantÃ¡namo, she added. Raids have often been needlessly violent, she said police officials break down doors and wake a suspect with a gun to his head, often in front of his wife and children. \"Everything is being done to create aggression in a person,\" she said. \"They do not need to raid the house at 2 a. m. \" One of her former GuantÃ¡namo patients was harassed so relentlessly by police that he became suicidal and ran off to Syria, where he was killed. \"He was such a gentle person,\" she said sadly. \"By treating these people like this you create a climate of revenge and the sense that they have no place at home. \" There is no doubt that Tunisia has a terrorism problem. It has been grappling with attacks from Al groups since 2013. The violence escalated to spectacular attacks in 2015 and 2016 that killed more than 70 people, many of them foreign tourists at a national museum and at a beach resort hotel. Moreover, Tunisians reportedly make up the largest number of foreign fighters to have joined the Islamic State and other extremist groups in Syria and Iraq, and some have been encouraged to conduct attacks when they return home. After an attack killed 12 members of the presidential guard in November 2015, the government imposed a state of emergency. At least 139 Tunisians have been placed under house arrest since, according to Human Rights Watch, which documented the cases in a report released in September. The sanctions have been justified in the context of countering terrorism but have \"left people facing stigmatization and unable to pursue studies and work,\" it stated. International human rights officials have voiced growing concerns of abuses resurfacing in Tunisia. In a report released this week, Amnesty International accused the Tunisian police and security forces of employing repressive measures used by past dictatorships, including torture, deaths in custody, arbitrary house raids and often unlawful harassment of suspects, their families and communities. Ben Emmerson, the United Nations special rapporteur for human rights while countering terrorism, said during a recent visit to Tunisia that human rights should be central to counterterrorism operations, noting that torture and other repressive measures fuel radicalism. Mr. Hammami says he feels the police are pushing him that way. The son of a farmer from Tunisia\\'s poor northwest, he says he originally left for Italy in 1986 in search of work. There he fell in with an Islamic missionary group, Tablighi Jamaat, and later traveled to Pakistan, where he obtained refugee status. He was arrested in Pakistan and handed over to the American military in 2002 and transferred to GuantÃ¡namo, where he was accused of training in Qaeda camps in Afghanistan. The Americans also say they found his identification papers in Tora Bora, the last redoubt of Osama bin Laden in the country, according to papers released by WikiLeaks. Mr. Hammami, who denies going to Afghanistan or having any links to Qaeda or terrorism, was eventually released without charge. Whatever his past, he says after nearly 20 years away, he just wants to live quietly. \"I never committed a crime,\" he said. \"I don\\'t have a record, no theft, no ethics problems, nothing. \" \"My only demand is to be stable, but they don\\'t let me live my life in stability,\" he said. \"They are pushing you towards death. \"',\n",
              " 'The F. B. I. had a job offer for Nick Young, a veteran Washington transit officer: Become an undercover informant for the bureau and gather information at local mosques on fellow Muslims who might pose a terrorism threat. The clandestine work would be \"a lot sexier\" than his current job, Mr. Young remembered an agent named Ryan telling him. And it could pay him a lot of money if the intelligence was good. Mr. Young turned him down. But it would not be the last time he would see the F. B. I. agent. Last August, five years later, Mr. Young was summoned to the headquarters of the transit agency, Metro, where Ryan and other agents were waiting for him. \"You probably don\\'t recognize me, do you?\" Ryan, whose beard was now thicker, asked him. \"Oh, I recognize you,\" Mr. Young said. This time, the agent handcuffed Mr. Young on a charge of supporting the Islamic State â€” a case built, in a twist, by an informant who posed as a terrorist fighter. The prosecution of Mr. Young, the only law enforcement officer among more than 100 Americans who have been accused of helping the Islamic State, offers a revealing look at the F. B. I. \\'s shadowy efforts to identify possible Islamic extremists. President Trump has vowed to intensify the effort as part of a campaign to \"annihilate\" the militant group. Mr. Young\\'s case also poses a challenge to the F. B. I. \\'s expanding use of undercover operations to identify Islamic State sympathizers inside the United States who might travel overseas to help the terrorist group or commit \"lone wolf\" attacks at home. His lawyer claims that the F. B. I. entrapped him, with undercover operatives popping in and out of his life for at least six years. To law enforcement officials, however, Mr. Young represents one of their worst fears: a longtime officer, with access to sensitive facilities, who they suspect was \"radicalized\" to support Islamic extremism. He is charged with providing \"material support\" to the Islamic State, in the form of $245 worth of Google Play gift cards. The authorities say he gave the gift cards to a Muslim friend named Mo â€” in reality, an undercover informant â€” to support recruitment for the terrorist group. Before now, very few American suspects linked to the Islamic State have spoken out. But in three and a half hours of interviews from jail, Mr. Young, a convert to Islam, portrayed himself and many other American Muslims under investigation as victims of religious persecution. He accused an \"overzealous\" F. B. I. of \"manufacturing\" the case. \"I know for sure I wouldn\\'t have been targeted if I was an evangelic Christian or a Sikh or a Hindu or something,\" said Mr. Young, 37. \"I\\'m not a terrorist,\" he added. \"Seeing these horrible allegations and the way they\\'re trying to paint me, it\\'s just a nightmare. \" Officials at the F. B. I. and the Justice Department declined to comment on the case. In general, the F. B. I. said in a statement, the investigative techniques used in such national security cases \"are subject to vigorous oversight and require us to use the least intrusive means possible. \" The F. B. I. has moved aggressively since the rise of the Islamic State in 2014 to identify suspected extremist supporters inside the United States, opening hundreds of investigations and generating convictions from Brooklyn to Southern California, often against young Muslim men. Mr. Trump has declared that the country must do more to confront what he calls \"radical Islamic terrorism,\" including the possibility of expanding surveillance and intelligence operations, creating a \"registry\" of American Muslims, and reviving torture as an interrogation technique. While Mr. Trump has sent mixed signals on some of those proposals, they have worried some civil liberties advocates, who say they are eager to see whether the Justice Department and the F. B. I. seek to expand their investigative powers still further in domestic terrorism cases. Mr. Young sees himself as a pawn in that broader fight. He acknowledges holding passionate views about the Middle East and the \"slaughter\" of Syrians by the government of President Bashar . On breaks from the transit agency, Mr. Young traveled to Libya twice in 2011 with body armor to join rebels fighting the Qaddafi regime. \"I didn\\'t kill anyone while I was there,\" he said, laughing, but \"I got shot at a lot. \" He insisted that he had never supported terrorists. He plans to take the witness stand at his trial, an unusual tactic for a terrorism suspect. \"Nick doesn\\'t have anything to hide,\" said Nicholas D. Smith, one of his lawyers. As he waits for his trial date, he sits in a rural jail in Warsaw, Va. reading science fiction occasionally, with \"The Jerry Springer Show\" sometimes playing on a television in the background. \"My brain\\'s turning to mush,\" he said. He said the jail had denied him access to Muslim prayer sessions. But the conditions are far better, he added, than the solitary confinement he was placed in for 23 hours a day for months after his arrest. That ordeal, he said, has caused lingering panic attacks and other problems. Unlike the bulk of the Americans charged with supporting the Islamic State, Mr. Young is not accused of plotting violence or trying to travel to the Middle East to fight with the group. He said he was under investigation for so long, it was almost inevitable that the authorities would find a way to charge him. \"At the end of the day, the crime I\\'m being accused of â€” a crime of sending gift cards â€” it would be laughable if it wasn\\'t really happening,\" Mr. Young said. He declined to explain the gift cards, citing a pretrial order that restricts what he can say about documents in the case. But he said his explanation would come out at his trial. Since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, dozens of terrorism defendants caught in undercover stings have claimed in court that they were illegally entrapped into saying or doing incriminating things. None have succeeded. Judges have given the Justice Department wide latitude in using undercover stings in terrorism cases. \"You almost need a perfect case\" to prove entrapment, said Seamus Hughes, a terrorism expert at George Washington University\\'s Program on Extremism, \"and that\\'s difficult to find. \" Still, several legal analysts said Mr. Young might have a legitimate shot, because of the unusual elements of the F. B. I. \\'s yearslong undercover investigation. They point out that even an charge that Mr. Young faces is based on his statements to agents about a fictional F. B. I. investigation into the whereabouts of a Islamic State fighter who never existed. Mr. Young apparently first came onto the F. B. I. \\'s radar around 2010 because he knew a fellow student at George Mason University, Zachary A. Chesser, who, like him, was a white convert to Islam from Northern Virginia and attended the same mosque. The F. B. I. interviewed Mr. Young that year as part of an investigation into Mr. Chesser, who ultimately pleaded guilty to charges after he was accused of threatening the creators of \"South Park\" over the show\\'s depiction of the Prophet Muhammad. Mr. Young does not appear to have been an F. B. I. target at the time, even as undercover informants began giving the bureau reports about the activities of him and some of his associates. He continued working as an armed officer patrolling subways and bus lines. He said F. B. I. agents â€” Ryan and a second agent â€” had met with him twice in 2011 to recruit him as an informant. Mr. Young said he found the idea of becoming an informant distasteful. The F. B. I. said in a court affidavit that he had used stronger language in a conversation with one of the bureau\\'s undercover informants, saying that if he were ever betrayed by one, \"that person\\'s head would be in a cinder block\" at the bottom of a lake. Based on wiretaps and statements from informants, the F. B. I. reported that Mr. Young had made a number of other incendiary and perhaps even threatening comments over the years about Muslim informants, F. B. I. investigators and \"kaffirs\" â€” or nonbelievers. Mr. Young acknowledged that he could have used \"a little \" in some of his private remarks. But he said he had never meant them to be taken literally. \"Everyone\\'s capable of saying stupid, blustery things,\" said Mr. Smith, his lawyer. Some F. B. I. officials pressed to bring criminal charges against Mr. Young years ago, but the Justice Department rebuffed them because of an apparent lack of evidence that he was involved in supporting terrorism, according to law enforcement officials. It was not until 2014 that Mr. Young crossed the line into supporting terrorism, the Justice Department now alleges. That was when he first met Mo, a Middle Easterner who said he was a military reservist, at a mosque where he prayed. Mr. Young said he had suspected early on that Mo might be an informant because of his strange mannerisms. But his concerns eased, and the two became friends, meeting at a Starbucks or elsewhere. Mo later told Mr. Young that he was thinking of traveling to Syria to join the Islamic State, prosecutors said. While Mr. Young sometimes appeared to offer Mo advice on how best to avoid government scrutiny if he went to the Middle East, he also told him at times that he did not need to join the terrorist group â€” at least not then, according to the F. B. I. \\'s account. \"There is no one with a gun to your head that is counting down,\" he told Mo in a conversation recorded in October 2014. Such statements, said Mr. Smith, his lawyer, show that \"the government is really grasping at straws here. \" Prosecutors are acting on \"really more of a hunch that he might commit crimes in the future,\" he said, \"and they can\\'t prove it. \"',\n",

              " 'At a Donald Trump rally in North Carolina, a proud Ginger Glover waved a \"Lyin\\' Hillary Doll\" with a special edition noose on it.  Watch a clip with Glover at the Wednesday rally here via NBC News :  Glover said the noose was her way of making a point that Hillary Clinton should be \"incarcerated at the very least,\" but when asked said she doesn\\'t think Clinton should be killed.  Yet her employees put the noose on the doll for her and she brought it out in public and waved it around. For \"effect.\"  Where is all of the Trump rallies\\' violent rhetoric and imagery going?  Donald Trump seems to attract people who are angry and want someone to blame.  The Washington Post did an incredible story on Melanie Austin, a Trump supporter who said Trump sees the world like she does. She realized this days after she had been injected with something intended to \"calm\" her, after she was involuntarily committed for homicidal ideation against President Obama.  The first time she had seen him, at a rally in June, she was just beginning to realize how many people saw the world the way she did, that she was one among millions. At the time, her hips were still sore from a series of injections intended to calm her. She had gotten them in February, during a difficult time in her life, when she had been involuntarily hospitalized for several weeks after what she called a \"rant,\" a series of online postings that included one saying that Obama should be hanged and the White House fumigated and burned to the ground. On her discharge papers, in a box labeled \"medical problem,\" a doctor had typed \"homicidal ideation.\"  Donald Trump and the alt-right, and indeed way too many elected Republicans, have already pointed these folks at Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama as Evil People Who Must Be Harmed. When you attract unstable people who are easily manipulated out of anger and fear and then direct them to harm someone, as Trump and his advisers have done suggesting Hillary Clinton might be shot and saying she should be executed with a firing squad, you are responsible for inciting violence.  Things are not going well for Trump supporters, and even buoyed as they are with unscientific online polls and delusions fed by the alt-right media and Fox News, they smell defeat.  Perhaps that\\'s not connected to this specific woman who brought a Hillary Clinton doll in a noose to wave at a Trump rally last night, but it is a trend we\\'re seeing in general â€“ angry Trump fans using more and more violent rhetoric.  There will be more of this, not less, as Trump\\'s likely defeat becomes reality outside of tinfoil circles.  This is political intimidation that mimics Donald Trump\\'s despotic promises to jail Clinton even though she\\'s been cleared of wrong-doing in all of the relentless Republican investigations into her activities as Secretary of State.  Of which there will be plenty more, Republicans promise us, should she win â€” because just like the Trump camp doesn\\'t want you to vote, Republicans only want government to work when they\\'re not in power.  The potent mixture of tinfoil and rage is creating a toxic brew of violent fantasies and rhetoric among Trump supporters.  Image: Screencap from NBC News video',\n",
              " 'U.S. lawmakers said on Monday they did not know when legislation to impose new sanctions on Russia might come up for a vote in the House of Representatives, and the White House said it had concerns about the measure. The legislation passed the Senate by a nearly unanimous margin two weeks ago, looking like it might complicate President Donald Trump\\'s desire for warmer relations with Moscow, where officials have denounced new sanctions. A White House official said the Trump administration felt some provisions in the bill would interfere with its ability to use sanctions to try to influence Russia. \"There are some provisions in the Senate bill that would unprecedentedly impair Treasury\\'s ability to wield its sanctions tools, risk endangering the transatlantic sanctions coalition, and weaken the State Department\\'s ability to credibly signal that we would calibrate our sanctions in response to Russian behavior,\" the official said in an emailed statement, requesting anonymity. Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a co-author of the legislation, said he hoped for progress within the next day or two on a procedural issue that has kept the House from taking up the Countering Iran\\'s Destabilizing Activities Act, which also includes the new sanctions against Russia. The measure must pass the House, where Trump\\'s fellow Republicans control a larger majority than in the Senate, before it can be sent for Trump to sign into law or veto. House Republican leaders said last week that the Senate bill violated a constitutional requirement that any bill affecting government revenues must originate in the House, something known as a \"blue slip\" violation. House aides also said leadership had not yet decided whether to vote on the Senate bill once the \"blue slip\" issue was resolved, or first refer it to House committees, which could further delay or change it. Democrats said they were skeptical about the \"blue slip\" explanation, noting that the issue had resolved very quickly in recent years for other bills. Corker said Senate Republicans remained solidly behind the legislation. \"I\\'ve heard no one here have second thoughts, by the way\" he told Reuters. \"If you find one, please tell me.\" White House spokesman Sean Spicer declined comment during a news briefing on Monday on whether the administration would support the sanctions bill.',\n",

              " 'The presidents of the United States and Mexico spoke by phone on Friday after relations between the neighboring countries frayed further over Donald Trump\\'s border wall plan, with the U.S. leader calling the talk friendly but still demanding reworked trade and other ties. The call between Trump and Enrique Pena Nieto came a day after the Mexican president scrapped a meeting set for next week at the White House over Trump\\'s demand that Mexico pay for a multibillion-dollar wall along the lengthy southern U.S. border with Mexico. Mexico insists it will not pay for it. Both countries issued statements saying Trump and Pena Nieto recognized their clear differences of opinion on the payment demand, and agreed to settle the matter as part of a broader discussion on all aspects of the two nations\\' relationship. Financial markets took news of the call as a sign that the crisis in U.S-Mexican relations just days after Trump took office had eased. Mexico\\'s peso rose on the news. Mexico\\'s government statement said Trump and Pena Nieto agreed not to talk publicly for now about payment for the wall. The White House did not immediately clarify whether Trump had agreed not to publicly discuss how the wall would be paid for. During a joint news conference at the White House with visiting British Prime Minister Theresa May after the call, Trump did not mention the wall even as he spoke expansively about U.S. relations with Mexico. \"As you know, Mexico - with the United States - has out-negotiated us and beat us to a pulp through our past leaders. They\\'ve made us look foolish,\" Trump told the news conference. \"We have a trade deficit of $60 billion with Mexico. On top of that, the border is soft and weak, drugs are pouring in,\" added Trump, who during the U.S. presidential campaign accused Mexico of sending rapists and other criminals into the United States. The United States had a $58.8 billion trade deficit with its southern neighbor in the 11 months ending last November. Trump called his hour long talk with Pena Nieto \"very, very friendly,\" said he has a \"very good relationship\" with him and expressed \"great respect for Mexico.\" Mexico and the White House both called the meeting productive and constructive. Nevertheless, Trump showed no signs of backing off pledges to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico and Canada and slap high tariffs on American companies that have moved jobs south of the border. Mexico sends 80 percent of its exports to the United States, and about half of Mexico\\'s foreign direct investment over the past two decades has come from its northern neighbor. \"We are going to be working on a fair relationship and a new relationship\" with Mexico, Trump told the news conference with May. \"But the United States cannot continue to lose vast amounts of business, vast amounts of companies and millions and millions of people losing their jobs. That won\\'t happen with me.\" Trump said the United States will renegotiate trade deals and other aspects of America\\'s relationship with Mexico, adding, \"And in the end I think it will be good for both countries.\" U.S. congressional leaders said on Thursday they would take up legislation to provide $12 billion to $15 billion to pay for the wall. Trump, who has insisted that Mexico will reimburse the United States for the entire cost, signed a directive on Wednesday for the wall to proceed, part of a package of measures aimed at curbing illegal immigration. The wall plan has angered Mexicans, and Trump\\'s policies toward Mexico have put Pena Nieto on the defensive. The Republican president views the wall, a major promise during his election campaign, as part of a package of measures to curb illegal immigration. Mexico has long insisted it will not heed Trump\\'s demands to pay for the construction project. On Thursday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer sent the Mexican peso falling when he told reporters that Trump wanted a 20 percent tax on Mexican imports to pay for the wall. Spicer gave few details, but his comments resembled an existing idea, known as a border adjustment tax, that the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives is considering as part of a broad tax overhaul. Trump said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network on Friday that there were options besides an import tax that could be \"much more positive\" for both countries. The White House said Friday\\'s call also covered \"the importance of the friendship between the two nations, and the need for the two nations to work together to stop drug cartels, drug trafficking and illegal guns and arms sales.\" Mexico\\'s government said the U.S. trade deficit also came up. In Mexico City, billionaire Mexican businessman Carlos Slim said a united Mexico was ready to help the government negotiate with Trump and called on all political parties to support Pena Nieto in his discussions with the U.S. president. In a rare news conference by the generally media-shy mogul, Slim said Mexico needed to negotiate from a position of strength, noting that Trump, who he called a \"great negotiator,\" represented a major change in how politics will be conducted.',\n",

              " 'The pace of approvals for nuclear reactor restarts in Japan, where most plants remain shut following the Fukushima disaster, is unlikely to pick up in the coming years, the new head of Japan s nuclear regulator said in an interview on Tuesday. The comments from Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) Chairman Toyoshi Fuketa suggest Japan may not make headway in meeting its electricity generation targets. By 2030, the country was expecting nuclear to power about one-fifth of its generation. However, utilities are having difficulty grappling with tougher rules on protecting reactors from natural disasters in the earthquake-prone country. Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, the world s worst since Chernobyl in 1986, the NRA was set up in 2012 to draft new safety standards that have been described as among the world s toughest. Since then, 12 reactors at six nuclear plants have passed the safety requirements needed to restart, but only four reactors are currently operating. One more reactor that resumed operations after meeting the requirements has been shut down for scheduled maintenance. Most of the approvals have been for reactors in western Japan and not on the east coast where Tokyo Electric Power Co s Fukushima Daiichi station was located. The plant suffered multiple reactor meltdowns after an earthquake on the northeast coast caused a tsunami that swamped the site. We have accumulated experience in safety reviews, but comparatively speaking, many of the plants in eastern Japan that we are reviewing now have difficult natural conditions, Fuketa, 60, said in the interview. It s doubtful the pace of approvals would quicken. A majority of Japanese oppose nuclear power after Fukushima and restarts are a delicate political issue rather than just a matter of meeting technical safety requirements. When asked if he could place a number of how many reactors may be approved for a resumption of operations in the next five years, Fuketa said: I honestly do not know. About a dozen other reactors are going through safety checks as part of a relicensing process under the new rules. Fuketa is known for taking tough positions during safety reviews of reactors and has been instrumental in directing the clean-up of the wrecked Fukushima plant. Japan s government set an energy mix plan in 2015 that forecasts relying on nuclear power to generate between 20 to 22 percent of the country s electricity in 2030. That requires having about 30 reactors operating by then. Japan s nine regional power utilities and a wholesaler, Japan Atomic Power Co, have 42 nuclear reactors for commercial use, with a total generating capacity of 41,482 megawatts.',\n",

              " '\"Unbelievable\", \"embarrassing\" even \"dangerous\" are some of the words the financial elite gathered at the World Economic Forum conference in the Swiss resort of Davos have been using to describe U.S. Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump. Although some said they still expected his campaign to founder before his party picks its nominee for the November election many said it was no longer unthinkable that he could be the Republican candidate. Some noted that whatever the outcome, a heated campaign, which has also seen self-proclaimed Socialist Bernie Sanders provide a tough challenge to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, could alter the U.S. political environment, giving vent to new populist anger on both sides of the political divide. Trump\\'s nationalist rhetoric, particularly proposals to ban Muslims from entering the United States, tax goods made abroad and build a wall on the Mexican border, were never the sort of thing to appeal to the free trade crowd that typically gathers at events like the annual Davos economic forum. \"Clearly it is not a rhetoric that is inviting for integration,\" said Chile\\'s Finance Minister, Rodrigo Valdes, referring to his comments on the campaign trail. \"In Chile we have a deep view that integration of the Americas is a good thing, whether it is goods, financing and yes people. So I\\'d be happier with a more welcoming rhetoric.\" Among the present and former government officials in the Swiss resort was Eric Cantor, former Republican majority leader in the U.S. House of Representatives, now vice-chairman of Moelis & Co, an investment bank. Like much of the Republican party\\'s establishment, he had cold words for Trump. \"He\\'s not serious. He\\'s amazing at promoting his personal brand and reflecting an underlying anger at home,\" Cantor said. \"Trump Fever is an unsustainable phenomenon that will not translate into a victory for the candidate.\" But for Ray Nolte, chief investment officer of Skybridge Capital, a $13 billion hedge fund whose founder has supported other Republican candidates including Jeb Bush, such establishment pronouncements sound like wishful thinking. \"Is Donald going to be the nominee? I don\\'t know. It\\'s sure looking that way now,\" Nolte said. \"Anyone here (at Davos) who is in the mainstream says there is no way he could possibly get the nomination. When I hear that, it probably means it is going to happen.\" Noting the challenge to Clinton from Sanders, which he said could pull her to the left on issues like financial regulation, Nolte said institutional investors were already paying attention to the prospect of increased U.S. political volatility from the election. Arianna Huffington, whose Huffington Post news website once insisted on covering Trump, a former reality TV star, as an entertainment figure rather than a politician, said the site reversed its policy once he announced his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States, which made him too \"dangerous\" to ignore. \"I feel the mainstreaming of Donald Trump, instead of him being treated as an extreme, dangerous candidate, is really the most troubling aspect of American politics right now,\" she said. \"He\\'s being interviewed on all the main shows, and he\\'s being asked questions about what his first State of the Union address would be like if he wins, instead of actually being forced to answer the tough questions about his policy, especially his policy of wanting to ban Muslims from entering the U.S., which is so dangerous, so un-American and should really be the center of the coverage of Trump.\" For Dominic Barton, global managing director for business consultancy McKinsey, Trump has turned the political campaign itself into \"entertainment\", which could hurt the global image of the United States. \"It\\'s a bit embarrassing globally. But I think there\\'s a big difference between the rhetoric and the reality, and I think most people will see that and discount it. But it\\'s incredible how long its been going for. It\\'s just unbelievable,\" he said. But not everyone is worried. Sandeep Dadlani, executive vice president of Indian outsourcing firm Infosys, said his firm has earned the majority of its revenue in the United States for more than 30 years. \"We have seen many elections come and go. It is common in all election seasons for rhetoric and extreme personalities to shine. Inevitably we have found governments from both sides to eventually come up with sensible policies,\" he said.

              " \"A North Korean state agency threatened on Thursday to use nuclear weapons to sink Japan and reduce the United States to ashes and darkness for supporting a U.N. Security Council resolution and sanctions over its latest nuclear test. The Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee, which handles the North s external ties and propaganda, also called for the breakup of the Security Council, which it called a tool of evil made up of money-bribed countries that move at the order of the United States. The four islands of the archipelago should be sunken into the sea by the nuclear bomb of Juche. Japan is no longer needed to exist near us, the committee said in a statement carried by the North s official KCNA news agency. Juche is the North s ruling ideology that mixes Marxism and an extreme form of go-it-alone nationalism preached by state founder Kim Il Sung, the grandfather of the current leader, Kim Jong Un. Regional tension has risen markedly since the reclusive North conducted its sixth, and by far its most powerful, nuclear test on Sept. 3, following a series of missile tests, including one that flew over Japan. The 15-member Security Council voted unanimously on a U.S.-drafted resolution and a new round of sanctions on Monday in response, banning North Korea s textile exports that are the second largest only to coal and mineral, and capping fuel supplies. The North reacted to the latest action by the Security Council, which had the backing of veto-holding China and Russia, by reiterating threats to destroy the United States, Japan and South Korea. Let s reduce the U.S. mainland into ashes and darkness. Let s vent our spite with mobilization of all retaliation means which have been prepared till now, the statement said. Japan s Nikkei stock index and dollar/yen currency pared gains, although traders said that was more because of several Chinese economic indicators released on Thursday rather than a reaction to the North s latest statement. South Korea s won also edged down around the same time over domestic financial concerns. Despite the North s threats, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said he was against having nuclear weapons in his country, either by developing its own arsenal or bringing back U.S. tactical nuclear weapons that were withdrawn in the early 1990s. To respond to North Korea by having our own nuclear weapons will not maintain peace on the Korean peninsula and could lead to a nuclear arms race in northeast Asia, Moon said in an interview with CNN. South Korea s Unification Ministry also said it planned to provide $8 million through the U.N. World Food Programme and UNICEF to help infants and pregnant women in the North. The move marks Seoul s first humanitarian assistance for the North since its fourth nuclear test in January 2016 and is based on a longstanding policy of separating humanitarian aid from politics, the ministry said. The North s latest threats also singled out Japan for dancing to the tune of the United States, saying it should never be pardoned for not offering a sincere apology for its never-to-be-condoned crimes against our people , an apparent reference to Japan s wartime aggression. It also referred to South Korea as traitors and dogs of the United States. Japan criticized the North s statement harshly. This announcement is extremely provocative and egregious. It is something that markedly heightens regional tension and is absolutely unacceptable, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, visiting India, called for strict enforcement of the U.N. resolution, saying the world must force a change. The 15-member Security Council voted unanimously on a U.S.-drafted resolution and a new round of sanctions against North Korea on Monday in response to its latest and most powerful test, banning North Korea s textile exports that are the second largest only to coal and mineral, and capping fuel supplies. North Korea had already rejected the Security Council resolution, vowing to press ahead with its nuclear and missile programs. A tougher initial U.S. draft of Monday s resolution was weakened to win the support of China, the North s lone major ally, and Russia. Significantly, it stopped short of imposing a full embargo on oil exports to North Korea, most of which come from China. The latest sanctions also make it illegal for foreign firms to form commercial joint ventures with North Korean entities. U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed that North Korea will never be allowed to threaten the United States with a nuclear-tipped missile, but has also asked China to do more to rein in its neighbor. China in turn favors an international response to the problem. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the international community had reached a high consensus on trying to realize a peaceful solution. We urge the relevant directly involved parties to seize the opportunity and have the political nerve to make the correct political choice as soon as possible, Hua told a regular press briefing. The North accuses the United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, of planning to invade and regularly threatens to destroy it and its Asian allies. The United States and South Korea are technically still at war with North Korea because the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce and not a peace treaty.

              " 'It s no secret that German Chancellor Angela Merkel is no fan of Donald Trump. They had a frosty visit when she visited the United States. He infamously refused to shake her hand for the cameras as is customary in the Oval Office, and even reportedly presented her with some kind of bogus bill for supposed expenses with regards to financial obligations to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).Combine that with the fact that Trump publicly scolded our fellow NATO member nations at the summit in Brussels, and you have a recipe for Chancellor Merkel coming to a very grave conclusion: The United States of America can no longer be trusted to defend its NATO allies and support Article V which states that when one nation is attacked, all nations are attacked as long as Donald Trump is president. This is an especially striking blow, since the only time Article V of NATO has been invoked is when the U.S. was attacked on September 11, 2001.With all of this in mind, Merkel has made a stunning and historic statement to her fellow member nations of the European Union: Thanks to Trump, America is not to be relied on any longer. Merkel said of Trump s America: The times in which we could completely depend on others are on the way out. I ve experienced that in the last few days. We Europeans truly have to take our fate into our own hands. Merkel had the same advice regarding Great Britain, though with less harsh words. She still insists that respectful relationships with Britain and America will be maintained, but told the remaining European Union nations, we have to fight for our own destiny. Another warning came as a result of Trump s refusal to commit to the Paris Climate Agreement at the G7 Summit. All of the other six member nations of the agreement reaffirmed their commitment to addressing the problem of climate change, but Trump and thus the United States did not. Merkel said that this is a very difficult, not to say very unsatisfactory development and a six against one dialogue with regards to a grave world matter. A matter that, by the way, Trump has previously called a hoax. Here is the tweet that confirms his crazy views there:The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012In short, with Donald Trump as president, the United States of America is no longer the leader of the free world. Germany is. Hopefully, Merkel gets re-elected, and can diminish Trump s power on the world stage until he is either impeached and removed from office, resigns, or his term ends.The fate of the free world depends on it.',\n",

              " 'Americans in liberal enclaves from New York to San Francisco reacted with shock and despair on Wednesday to Republican businessman Donald Trump\\'s defeat of Democrat Hillary Clinton, with many struggling to explain the result to their children. Trump, who had never before run for public office, won on a broad wave of support both from the Republican U.S. heartland and by flipping previously Democratic states, including Pennsylvania, Florida and Ohio, helping his party protect majorities in both chambers of Congress. The victory stunned residents of major cities up and down the East and West coasts, many of whom had trusted opinion polls that had long predicted a Clinton victory but were proven profoundly wrong by Tuesday\\'s results. \"I\\'m feeling physical pain. I\\'m shocked. I\\'m sad,\" said Sofia Huizar, 30, as she waited outside the Manhattan hotel where Clinton conceded her loss on Wednesday morning, some eight hours after Trump declared victory. Huizar, a U.S. citizen who was born in Mexico, said she spent much of Tuesday night commiserating with family across the border. \"It\\'s a way to help process the fear,\" Huizar said. Trump\\'s campaign promises have included building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to stop illegal crossings and to deport the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States. Others, like Kim Priban, a 38-year-old nurse who lives in the Cleveland suburb of Boston Heights, Ohio, said they had a difficult time breaking the news to their children. Priban said she had proudly taken her 5-year-old daughter along to vote for Clinton, who would have been the first woman U.S. president, and on Wednesday morning had to discuss the result with her. \"I still haven\\'t quite figured out what to tell my daughter. I\\'ve been crying all day,\" Priban said. \"I feel like I have to go out and make my voice heard for women and children.\" Priban and Huizar are likely far from alone in the depth of their pain over Clinton\\'s loss, academic research suggests. A 2015 paper by researchers at Harvard University found that voters who supported Republican Mitt Romney\\'s unsuccessful White House bid reported sharper spikes in their unhappiness than parents following the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre of Connecticut schoolchildren or Boston residents after the deadly 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. While many Democrats along the coasts mourned Clinton\\'s defeat, Trump supporters celebrated the outcome, saying they hoped he would shake up a dysfunctional political system. \"The overwhelming majority of Americans want change, and this is a direct result. ... Trump is the disrupter, for better or for worse,\" said Kelley Smith, 33, who lives in Chicago and works in software sales. \"He\\'s a little bombastic. I don\\'t think he\\'s polished. But I don\\'t think he\\'s going to purposefully take our country down.\" The divide between the coasts and the heartland, evident not only in the results but also in the social media battles ahead of the election, made the Trump victory more shocking for liberals. Deena Pioli, an attorney from San Francisco, said she had rarely run into people who were not supporting Clinton, and that she now regrets that. \"Those of us here in San Francisco and California should not be so safe in our bubble,\" she said. Trump dropped his angry speaking style to take a conciliatory tone when he declared victory early Wednesday morning, saying, \"I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans.\" Clinton and Democratic President Barack Obama sounded similarly restrained. But the breadth of Trump\\'s win left his opponents urging self-examination. \"Folks should have deep humility in this moment,\" said civil rights activist DeRay Mckesson on Twitter. \"We all have things to learn from how Trump happened.\" Karen Parnett, a 48-year-old mother of three in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said she had been heartbroken to tell her children about Trump\\'s win, and said the result illustrated the growing anger of lower-income voters who believe their concerns are being ignored by Washington. \"I have too much at stake with three kids to just throw up my hands and weep and say that all is lost,\" Parnett said. \"There are new realities and we need as a country to reckon with what in the world we are going to do about the disenfranchisement of the white working poor.\" (This story has been refiled to fix typo in ninth paragraph)',\n",

Warren hammered away at Trump, calling him a loser and accused him of engaging in petty bullying, attacks on women, cheap racism, flagrant narcissism. Warren is hugely popular and influential with Democrats and liberals, and her series of tweets targeting Trump is seen by some as a sign that the primary season is effectively over and that the general election has begun.Here are Warren s tweets:Let s be honest @realDonaldTrump is a loser.

Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) March 21, 2016.@RealDonaldTrump stands ready to tear apart an America that was built on values like decency, community, and concern for our neighbors. Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) March 21, 2016The way I see it, it s our job to make sure @realDonaldTrump ends this campaign every bit the loser that he started it. Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) March 21, 2016Warren s tweets all hit at what are considered soft spots for Trump. He has boasted about his huge wealth, but numerous reports indicate that his net worth is considerably exaggerated. From Trump biographer Timothy O Brien:On a single day in August 2004, he told me his net worth was $4 billion to $5 billion, then revised that later the same day to $1.7 billion. Forbes said at the time he was worth $2.6 billion. A year later Donald told me he was worth $5 billion to $6 billion, but a brochure left on my nightstand at his Palm Beach resort said he was worth $9.5 billion.The tweets also discuss Trump s sexism, which appears to be one of his major Achilles heels. When Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly pointed out his history of demeaning women, he complained she was bleeding out of her whatever, and still months later has referred to her as crazy, which drew an uncharacteristic rebuke of a Republican from the right-wing propaganda network.Perhaps most importantly, Warren is indicating to the mainstream media and other Democrats that Trump s racially motivated campaign won t be off limits to criticism. So far, Republicans have largely avoided hitting Trump on his offensive language towards latinos and Muslims, as well as towards black activists (he called for protesters to be punched). The Democrats largely have no interest in courting the racists that dwell in the base of the GOP, and have no such restrictions on what they can say in the general election.It looks like the fight is truly on.',\n",

              " 'Ben, there are two very different things going on here. One is technical and related to the actual science and the actual statistics, the second is political, and is much more concerned with how incidents like this can be portrayed. The second is the issue here. The unfortunate fact is that the \\'secret science\\' meme is an extremely powerful rallying call to people who have no idea about what is going on. Claiming (rightly or wrongly) that information is being hidden has a huge amount of resonance (as you know), much more so than whether Douglass et al know their statistical elbow from a hole in the ground. Thus any increase in publicity on this - whether in the pages of Nature or elsewhere - is much more likely to bring further negative fallout despite your desire to clear the air. Whatever you say, it will still be presented as you hiding data. The contrarians have found that there is actually no limit to what you can ask people for (raw data, intermediate steps, additional calculations, residuals, sensitivity calculations, all the code, a workable version of the code on any platform etc.), and like Somali pirates they have found that once someone has paid up, they can always shake them down again. Thus, I would not advise any public statements on this. Instead, email you immediate superiors and the director with a short statement along the lines of what you suggest below (i.e. of course you want open science, the data *are* in the public domain (with links) and calls for more intermediate steps are just harassment to prevent scientists doing what they are actually paid too). I wouldn\\'t put in anything specifically related to McIntyre. A much more satisfying response would be to demonstrate how easy it is to replicate the analysis in the paper starting from scratch using openly available data (such as through Joe Sirott\\'s portal) and the simplest published MSU weighting function. If you can show that this can be done in a couple of hours (or whatever), it makes the other side look like incompetent amateurs. Maybe someone has a graduate student available....?

              " \"I first met Brandon Scott the day after Freddie Gray died. It was April 20, 2015. Mr. Scott, a member of the Baltimore City Council, was quietly observing a news conference where Baltimore police officials announced the suspension of six officers involved in the arrest of Mr. Gray, a black man who sustained a fatal spinal cord injury in a police transport van. In the blighted West Baltimore neighborhood where Mr. Gray grew up, protests were growing. Mr. Gray's death was wrenching for Baltimore a lot has transpired here since then. On the day Mr. Gray was buried, riots broke out, prompting Maryland's governor to call in the National Guard. The fiery state's attorney, Marilyn Mosby, promptly indicted the six officers on charges including murder. The city paid $6. 4 million to the Gray family. With the murder rate soaring, the mayor fired the police chief â€” and decided not to run for office again, as the city struggled to heal. Then came the officers' trials, which ended this week without a single conviction. Throughout, I have repeatedly interviewed Mr. Scott. He is 32, and the vice chairman of the Council committee that oversees the Baltimore police. Before being elected in 2011, he worked in city government and the 300 Men March, an group here. On Thursday, we spoke again, about the latest developments and what has changed. Below is an edited and condensed excerpt from that conversation. Ms. Mosby's team has just accused the Police Department of undermining the prosecution. Does that concern you? My concerns are first and foremost that moving forward, we are doing what we need to do to repair our city â€” to improve relations. I have spent a good deal of time over the last year working on body cameras, working on trainings with young people. The most important thing â€” what gets lost in all of this, is that we are talking about the loss of a life. But I will be following up with the police commissioner, even though this happened before the current commissioner, to provide a response to those claims. You mentioned body cameras. Are the Baltimore police using them? They will, just like in New York or any other major city, they're going to be rolled out. We already have body cameras out there at this point, we are close to 200 officers. Body cameras were in the works before Freddie Gray, but most definitely it ratcheted up the pace. What else has changed? The department decided to improve the vans, so that's a change. And I'm partnering with an organization called Community Mediation, fostering dialogue between youth and the police. Community Mediation is now mediating some internal affairs complaints. A lot of things have changed, things that people don't see because they're behind the scenes. I've talked to a lot of people who feel as though in the end, justice was not served â€” either for Freddie Gray or for the police. What do you say to that? I think what people must know about American justice is that the way the system is set up, you have to have a certain burden of proof and if it's not met, then it's not met. You can be as angry as you want to be, but you have to understand the system and respect it. What about you? Do you personally think justice was served? I can't personalize it. Like myself, what I would do in a situation like that is talk to the family and see how they feel. If Mr. Gray's family feels like everything, from the charges, from the state's attorney proceeding with the trials, everything that has come out of it equals justice to them, then it's justice. That's a careful answer. You've always been so measured in answering my questions. I'm the grandson of poor farmers in rural North Carolina. I truly understand what it means for me being a young black man in this country. But I try not to be divisive, I try not to be polarizing, because that's the last thing we need right now. We have enough of that going on. We've talked about changes in the city. Have you changed? Of course I have changed. I have shifted my work I've tried to do things a little differently. You have to be uncomfortable. If you're not uncomfortable, if you haven't changed the way you operate from April 2015 to now, then you're saying the way our city was, was O. K. â€” and it wasn't. So what are you doing differently? For example today, I'm on the labor committee in the City Council and we voted to send a bill to the full council raising the city's minimum wage to $15 by 2022. I don't think that would have happened before last April. Is Baltimore perhaps a better place now, as a result of Freddie Gray's death? I can say that there have been changes in Baltimore for the better. But I can't say that Baltimore is a complete better place, because we still have a lot of people dying. So Ms. Mosby never got any convictions. What, if anything, did she achieve? Many folks feel that her charging the officers would not have happened under the previous state's attorney. That alone is a big deal for thousands of people in the city. But I would also remember â€” I talked to you and every other media outlet last year, I said, everyone should stay middle ground, because it's just the beginning of the process. Are you surprised at how it turned out? I thought that at least there would be one charge that would stick with at least one officer, but I can't say I'm surprised that it turned out the way that it did.\",\n",

              " 'With a bitter election campaign finally over, the Congress will reconvene this week to try to set aside its partisan differences long enough to keep the government from closing. As President-elect Donald Trump shapes his administration, Republicans are expected to move away from initial plans for compromise funding legislation and opt instead for a short-term measure to keep the government running into next year, when they will have control of Congress and the White House. Washington has been operating since Oct. 1 under a temporary \"continuing resolution\" on the budget. It expires on Dec. 9. Lawmakers will be trying to approve a new one before then. Mired in partisan gridlock, Congress in recent years has seldom completed the entire federal budget process, falling back frequently on stop-gap measures that last a few months. During their \"lame-duck\" session starting this week, lawmakers will have little time to draft another continuing resolution to cover funding U.S. agencies and military operations. Congress is tentatively set to adjourn by Dec. 17 and has an additional break over the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. A new Congress will meet in January, with the 100-seat Senate more closely split than before last week\\'s elections. Neither party will have the 60 votes needed to move legislation easily through the chamber. The voters last Tuesday also preserved the Republican majority in the House of Representatives, though it is slightly smaller, giving the Democrats more power to block the Republicans. Legislation to streamline federal regulations for new drugs could come up during the lame duck session. So could funding for cancer research, precision medicine and treatments for opioid addiction, said congressional aides. Some conservative House Republicans want a budget measure that will expire in March, which would coincide with needed action on the federal debt limit, according to House aides. Others have talked about a continuing resolution that would run until sometime February, giving the new president and Congress enough time to determine their priorities for more comprehensive funding legislation for the remainder of the federal fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30. Before the election shifted the political center of gravity in favor of Republicans, Republican leaders had talked about crafting funding legislation through negotiations with Democrats and President Barack Obama and approving it before Christmas.',\n",

              " 'The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday rejected a bid by Michigan to reinstate its Republican-backed ban on straight-ticket voting for the Nov. 8 general election. The justices left in place a decision by a federal district judge in Michigan who in July suspended a law that abolished straight-ticket voting, the practice of using one mark to vote for all candidates from one party, finding that it would disproportionately affect black voters. The 6th U.S. Court of Appeals upheld that finding last month, prompting the state to seek a stay from the Supreme Court. Two conservative justices on the eight-member court, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, voted to grant the request, the brief order said. The Michigan law, passed by a Republican-controlled legislature and signed by a Republican governor, was one of numerous voting measures passed at the state level that put new restrictions on voting. These measures also include stricter voter-identification laws and reduction of early-voting periods before election day. Proponents of the law, enacted in January, have said most states have moved away from a straight-ticket voting option. Removing the option forces voters to study candidates and encourages voters to make decisions based on criteria other than party affiliation, they said. Opponents say voting restrictions are aimed at reducing turnout of minorities, who are more likely to vote for Democrats. U.S. District Judge Gershwin Drain in July granted a preliminary injunction sought by civil rights and labor groups who sued Michigan\\'s Secretary of State Ruth Johnson and Attorney General Bill Schuette. The judge said elimination of straight-ticket voting would be a burden on voting rights and cause long wait times at polls. After Friday\\'s decision, Schuette said, \"It is my duty to defend Michigan\\'s laws, in this case a law that stands in 40 other states. Now the U.S. Supreme Court has spoken and I will respect that decision.\" The case is one of several voting disputes being litigated ahead of the election and is the second emergency application the Supreme Court has recently been asked to handle. On Aug. 31, the court rejected a bid by North Carolina to reinstate for November\\'s elections several voting restrictions, including a requirement that people show identification at the polls. The high court is short one justice following the death of conservative Antonin Scalia in February. As a result the court is evenly split 4-4 between liberals and conservatives.',\n",
              " 'Gay Mafia descends in 5 4 3 2 1 Given the current body of evidence, the American College of Pediatricians believes it is inappropriate, potentially hazardous to children, and dangerously irresponsible to change the age-old prohibition on same-sex parenting, whether by adoption, foster care, or reproductive manipulation, they conclude. This position is rooted in the best available science. A Utah juvenile court judge ruled Tuesday that a 1-year-old girl, who has been in the care of lesbian foster parents, cannot be adopted by them and should be sent to a more traditional home, says the Utah Division of Child and Family Services.According to CNN, the case is the first major challenge to same-sex adoption rights. LGBT civil rights groups are outraged over the ruling.While Judge Scott Johansen is not commenting on his decision publicly per the Utah Code of Judicial Conduct April Hoagland, one of the lesbians, married over a year ago to Beckie Peirce, told KUTV that Johansen said research indicates children in homosexual homes do not do as well as they do in heterosexual homes. [W]hen they asked to show his research he would not, Hoagland added.Hoagland and Peirce were approved as foster parents by the division of family services and are raising Peirce s two children. They say the state and the child s biological mother are supportive of their desire to adopt the child.As CBS reports, the two women are part of a group of same-sex couples who were permitted to become foster parents in Utah following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. Deborah Lindner, a spokeswoman for the Utah Foster Care Foundation, which trains foster parents for the state, said about 20 same-sex couples are caring for children in the foster program. Heartbreaking. We ve been told to take care like a mother would and I m her mother, and that s who she knows and she s just going to be taken away in seven days to probably another good, loving home, Hoagland said. But it s not fair, and it s not right, and it hurts me very badly, because I have done nothing wrong. Removing a child from a loving home simply because the parents are LGBT is outrageous, shocking and unjust, Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement. It also flies in the face of overwhelming evidence that children being raised by same-sex parents are just as healthy and well-adjusted as those with different-sex parents. At a time when so many children in foster care need loving homes, it is sickening to think that a child would be taken from caring parents who planned to adopt, he added.Utah child and family services said they are reviewing the ruling to determine their options, including whether to challenge the order. This is the first time there has been an attempt to deprive gay foster parents of their rights to care for an adoptive child, said CNN legal analyst Paul Callan. I believe it was a bizarre and highly unusual decision by the judge based most probably on religious beliefs rather than scientific facts. He predicted the case would be overturned by Utah appeals courts.In 2012, however, sociologist Mark Regnerus of the University of Texas at Austin published research in the journal Social Science Research on a large, random sample of Americans of ages 18-39 who were raised in different types of families. The study of some 3,000 adults found numerous differences that exist among the various family arrangements and that outcomes for children of gay and lesbian parents were suboptimal. In another study by Loren Marks of Louisiana State University also published in Social Science Research Marks debunked a 2005 policy brief on same-sex parents by the American Psychological Association (APA), in which the organization analyzed 59 studies and concluded [n]ot a single study has found children of lesbian or gay parents to be disadvantaged in any significant respect relative to children of heterosexual parents. Marks observed that 55 of the studies analyzed by APA did not even provide evidence of statistical power in accord with APA s own standards. [N]ot one of the 59 studies referenced in the 2005 APA Brief compares a large, random, representative sample of lesbian or gay parents and their children with a large, random, representative sample of married parents and their children, Marks noted. [W]e have been left with large, scientifically strong studies showing children do best with their married mother and father but which do not make comparisons with homosexual parents or couples, observed Peter Sprigg, senior fellow for policy studies at Family Research Council, and studies which purportedly show that children of homosexuals do just as well as other children but which are methodologically weak and thus scientifically inconclusive. However, Regnerus s research, called the New Family Structures Study, included comparisons with children raised by same-sex parents and surveyed young adults about their experiences growing up in their family situations as well as their current life. Unlike other studies, Regnerus also did not rely on reports of children, while they were still living in their homes, or the potentially biased reports of the parents.Regnerus found that children of homosexuals fared worse on 77 out of 80 outcome measures that compared children with same-sex parents to those from other family arrangements. Specifically, compared with children raised by married, biological parents, children of homosexual parents are more likely to be on public assistance, have lower educational attainment, and report both less safety in their childhood families and more continued negative impact from them. In addition, children of same-sex parents were found to more likely suffer from depression, to have been arrested more often, and to have had more male and female sexual partners if they are female.For children of lesbian mothers, statistical significance in both direct comparisons and with control subjects was found in numerous areas in Regnerus s research. Children of lesbian mothers were found to be four times more likely to be on welfare, more than three times more likely to be unemployed, nearly ten times more likely to have been touched sexually by a parent or other adult caregiver, and nearly four times as likely to have been physically forced to have sex against their will.Despite numerous statistically significant correlations in his study and his carefully controlled methodology, Regnerus still cautions these relationships do not indicate causality. Still, as Sprigg noted, The large number of significant negative outcomes in this study gives legitimate reason for concern about the consequences of homosexual parenting. According to Drs. Michelle Cretella and Den Trumbull:[M]others and fathers parent differently and make unique contributions to the overall development of the child. Psychological theory of child development has always recognized the critical role that mothers play in the healthy development of children. More recent research reveals that when fathers are absent, children suffer as well. Girls without fathers perform more poorly in school, are more likely to be sexually active and become pregnant as teenagers. Boys without fathers have higher rates of delinquency, violence, and aggression. [T]radition and science agree that biological ties and dual gender parenting are protective for children, the doctors continue. The limited research advocating childrearing by same-sex parents has severe methodological limitations. There is significant risk of harm inherent in exposing a child to the homosexual lifestyle.',\n",

              " 'Chad has withdrawn hundreds of troops from neighboring Niger, where they were helping local forces fight Boko Haram Islamist militants, humanitarian sources and officials said. The pull-out over the past two weeks could weaken a region-wide struggle against the militants who have killed tens of thousands of people, forced many more to flee and triggered a humanitarian crisis. There was no immediate explanation or comment from defense officials in Chad. But the move came a month after the vast central African country complained about an unexpected U.S. travel ban imposed on its nationals. Chad warned at the time the order could affect its security commitments - which include its involvement in the U.S.-backed fight against Boko Haram. Residents said the withdrawal had already had an impact on Niger s Diffa region, which has seen a string of attacks by Boko Haram militants crossing over from their base in neighboring Nigeria. Ibrahim Arimi from the border village of Bosso said banditry had increased since the Chadian troops started leaving and he had been temporarily moved to another village for safety. Diffa parliamentarian Lamido Moumouni said residents had started complaining. They have come to rely on the forces so there is a perception that security will be lacking, he said by telephone. At its peak in 2016 after an attack in Bosso, Chad had 2,000 troops in Niger to help counter Boko Haram although security sources said this has fallen since. Boko Haram has attacked Chad, Niger and Cameroon from its base in northeast Nigeria. Its eight-year bid to carve out an Islamist caliphate has driven millions from their homes - more than 200,000 of them are now based in Diffa, with little prospect of returning home. Thousands of them are camped alongside an unfinished highway in the middle of a barren savannah with few resources. Chad s soldiers also occupy front-line positions in a peacekeeping force in northern Mali. Falling oil revenues after the price crash in 2014 has also sapped Chad s appetite for expensive regional security commitments, analysts say.',\n",

              " 'Fortune released their The World s 19 Most Disappointing Leaders list on March 30. Coming in at number one on the list is Michigan s Republican governor Rick Snyder.Fortune gave Snyder the Don t Blame Me, I m Just The Governor Award for his failures over his handling of the Flint water crisis. Fortune writes:Snyder and his team sparked national outrage after an attempt at cost-savings left the impoverished city of Flint, Mich. with a lead-tainted water supply that is being blamed for illness and brain damage, especially among its youngest residents. Called to testify before Congress, Snyder, who touted his competence in his gubernatorial campaign, labeled the experience the most humbling of his life then attempted to shift blame. He described it as a failure of government and blasted the Environmental Protection Agency for its dumb and dangerous rules on allowable amounts of lead in water systems.Because you don t win an award like that and not offer a response, Ari Adler, a spokesman for Snyder, said that Snyder is concerned with fixing problems, not internet polls. The rank of each leader received was based on internet votes. Though, the 19 leaders in the poll were chosen by Fortune s editorial staff.Adler also said: The decision on whether to use corrosion control in the Flint water supply was not about saving money, but rather was a mistake made by bureaucrats who misinterpreted a flawed federal rule. Gov. Snyder is the only leader at all levels of government involved in the Flint water crisis who has been willing to stand up and apologize, take responsibility for what happened on his watch, and tackle the problems head on to fix what happened in Flint and fix the system that caused it to happen. It s responses like this that make one wonder how much money Snyder has wasted after he hired two PR firms while the nation raged against him. You can t say that you have accepted responsibility for a crisis right after you blame other people for that crisis.There is also the fact that the Flint water crisis did not happen in a bubble. It happened while the Snyder administration worked fervently to erode democracy in Michigan. It happened while Detroit s and other communities school systems and critical infrastructure were left to ruin.That s why Snyder s sorry-not-sorry is even more disingenuous than it might seem at first glance. He has at no point even acknowledged that his administration s system-wide dismantlement of local governments and austerity measurements that have proven to be fatal, have anything to do with the crisis. The only thing Snyder kind-of-but-not-really acknowledges is that his administration is in charge and, therefore, shares some of the responsibility for the Flint water crisis on the basis of Snyder being Michigan s figurehead.So here s to Snyder s latest achievement. Let it be the first of many.Featured Image: (Photo by Brett Carlsen/Getty Images)',\n",

              " 'South African President Jacob Zuma on Tuesday asked the High Court to set aside a report by the anti-corruption watchdog on alleged influence-peddling in his government, saying he would instead set up a commission of inquiry into the allegations. The court has been hearing a case brought by Zuma who had challenged the right of the report s author, South Africa s anti-graft agency known as Public Protector, to call for a judicial inquiry to investigate the allegations. Zuma, 75, who previously described the State of Capture report as unfair in parliament, said setting up such an inquiry was his prerogative. The report published a year ago recommended a judicial investigation into allegations of systemic corruption by Zuma, some of his ministers and heads of state-owned companies. The report focused on allegations that Zuma s friends, the businessmen and brothers Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta, had influenced the appointment of ministers. Zuma and the Guptas have denied the accusations. In a fresh application on Tuesday, Zuma s lawyers argued that the entire report by former Public Protector head Thuli Madonsela should be set aside. Should the court grant his application, Zuma would set up a separate commission of inquiry himself within 30 days of the date of the order, court papers presented by his lawyers said. The main opposition Democratic Alliance party opposes Zuma s application, saying it is unconstitutional. It says it wants the court to support Madonsela s recommendation for a judicial inquiry.',\n",

They are already talking about a prison sentence, Francken, a member of Flemish nationalist party N-VA, said. The question is to what extent he would get a fair trial. It would be difficult for Spain to extradite Puigdemont in such a case, he said. While most European leaders have refrained from commenting on the Spanish crisis, saying it was an internal matter and the country s constitution should prevail, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel called for dialogue between Madrid and Barcelona[nL8N1MD34Z]. Michel, a centrist from French-speaking Wallonia, has governed in coalition with the N-VA since 2014, a period during which the party toned down its calls for more independence for Belgium s Dutch-speaking North. The relationship between Belgium and Spain soured over a similar issue in the 1990s and 2000s, when the country refused to extradite a Spanish couple wanted over alleged involvement with the Basque militant group ETA.',\n",

              " 'U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Thursday he would accept the result of the Nov. 8 election - \"if I win\" - fueling Republican concerns his stance would make it harder for his party to maintain control of Congress. His refusal to commit to accepting the election outcome was the standout remark of the third and final 2016 presidential debate between Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton on Wednesday night. It ratcheted up Trump\\'s allegations the election was being rigged against him, and became the latest flashpoint in an unusually acrimonious race three weeks before voters go to the polls. Clinton called the comment \"horrifying.\" President Barack Obama blasted Trump on Thursday at a rally in Miami Gardens, Florida, for Clinton and U.S. Representative Patrick Murphy, who is trying to unseat Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a Trump supporter. \"That is dangerous. Because when you try to sow the seeds of doubt in people\\'s minds about the legitimacy of the elections, that undermines our democracy. Then you\\'re doing the work of our adversaries for them,\" Obama said. Trump modified his comment at a rally in Ohio on Thursday, but did not back off. \"I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States, that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election - if I win,\" he said. He added he would accept \"a clear election result,\" but reserved the right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result. With Trump trailing in opinion polls, the focus ahead of the Nov. 8 vote is shifting to whether Republicans can keep their narrow majority in the Senate or even their larger advantage in the House of Representatives. Senator John McCain of Arizona, who lost the 2008 presidential election to Obama, said accepting the election result was \"the American way.\" \"I didn\\'t like the outcome of the 2008 election. But I had a duty to concede, and I did so without reluctance,\" McCain, who has opened a poll lead in his Senate re-election race, said in a statement. \"A concession isn\\'t just an exercise in graciousness. It is an act of respect for the will of the American people, a respect that is every American leader\\'s first responsibility.\" McCain has withdrawn his support for Trump. Asked on Wednesday night if he would commit to a peaceful transition of power, Trump, a businessman-turned-politician, replied: \"What I\\'m saying is that I will tell you at the time. I\\'ll keep you in suspense. OK?\" Trump\\'s statement, the most provocative in a debate that repeatedly descended into rancor, made headlines across the country and raised questions about his commitment to a peaceful transition of power, a cornerstone of American democracy. Clinton accused Trump of being Russian President Vladimir Putin\\'s puppet. Trump called Clinton a \"nasty woman\" and a criminal who should be barred from running. They did not exchange the customary handshake when the debate ended. On Thursday night the two candidates appeared together at a formal charity dinner in New York and shook hands there after giving speeches intended to roast each other. \"Just before taking the dais, Hillary accidentally bumped into me, and she very civilly said, \\'pardon me,\\'\" Trump joked. \"And I very politely replied, let me talk to you about that after I get into office.\" Trump has said Clinton should be imprisoned for her email practices as secretary of state. Clinton spoke after Trump at the dinner, which she joked was remarkable in itself. \"I didn\\'t think he\\'d be ok with a peaceful transition of power,\" she said. That show of humor was not the norm, however. Democrats jumped to ask Republican candidates whether they agreed with Trump, who is making his first run for public office against Clinton, a former senator and first lady. \"Do you agree with Donald Trump to question the results of the election?\" the Nevada Democratic Party asked in a release targeting Republican Joe Heck. Heck is in a tight race with Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto for retiring Democratic leader Harry Reid\\'s Senate seat. Trump\\'s comments did not worry his supporters. Marion Fields, 48, a registered Democrat who backs Trump, said he did not think concession would be an issue because Trump would win. Were he to lose, \"After it\\'s announced, you\\'d have to be a professional and concede.\" A CNN/ORC snap poll said 52 percent of Americans thought Clinton won the debate, to 39 percent for Trump. Trump donor and energy investor Dan Eberhart said Trump won. He disagreed with his rhetoric, but still backs the candidate. \"I think Hillary\\'s policies and track record are not what the country needs leading us forward for the next four years. And that backs me into supporting Trump,\" Eberhart said. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway sought on Thursday to defend Trump, saying in television interviews he was \"putting people on notice\" about voting irregularities. Trump has not offered specific evidence to back up his vote-rigging claims, and numerous studies have shown that the U.S. election system, which is run by the states, is sound. Trump has stepped up allegations that the election is being rigged against a backdrop of accusations that he had made improper sexual advances to women since a video emerged two weeks ago in which Trump boasted of such behavior. A 10th woman came forward on Thursday at a news conference in Manhattan with attorney Gloria Allred, a Clinton supporter who specializes in representing women in cases of alleged assault. Trump campaign spokeswoman Jessica Ditto called the news conference a \"coordinated, publicity-seeking attack\" by Allred. First lady Michelle Obama, a powerful campaigner for Clinton, renewed her criticism of Trump without naming him during a campaign event in Arizona. \"Decent men do not demean women. And we shouldn\\'t tolerate this behavior from any man, let alone a man who wants to be the president,\" she said.',\n",

              " 'A citizen\\'s complaint accusing Gov. Chris Christie of official misconduct in the closing of traffic lanes at the George Washington Bridge in 2013 can proceed, a municipal court judge in New Jersey ruled on Thursday, raising the possibility that Mr. Christie could face a criminal indictment. The judge, Roy F. McGeady of Bergen County, found that there was probable cause to believe the governor had engaged in official misconduct in connection with the lane closings, as claimed in a complaint filed in September by William J. Brennan of Wayne. As a result of Judge McGeady\\'s ruling, the Bergen County prosecutor\\'s office must now decide whether to seek an indictment against Mr. Christie. The unexpected development, which unfolded in a courtroom that typically deals with relatively minor crimes, is the latest problem for Mr. Christie, a Republican, related to the lane closings. In his complaint, Mr. Brennan, a retired firefighter with a history of filing lawsuits against government agencies, accuses Mr. Christie of failing to order subordinates to reopen access lanes to the bridge in Fort Lee on Sept. 11, 2013, the third consecutive day the lanes had been closed. The lane closings, which paralyzed traffic in the town, erupted into a scandal that helped derail Mr. Christie\\'s presidential ambitions and led to federal charges against three of his allies. Federal prosecutors say the closings were meant to punish Fort Lee\\'s mayor, a Democrat, for declining to endorse Mr. Christie for . Two of those allies are now on trial in federal court in Newark, accused of authorizing the closings and trying to cover up the true reason for them the third has pleaded guilty to his role in the closings and is the prosecution\\'s main witness. In his complaint, Mr. Brennan writes that the mayor, Mark J. Sokolich, and Fort Lee residents were deprived of \"the benefit and enjoyment of their community as a consequence of this intentional act. \" Mr. Brennan, 50, said in an interview on Thursday that he had been moved to file the complaint after a particular day of testimony in the federal trial. He said the basis for his complaint emerged when David Wildstein, who has pleaded guilty to orchestrating the scheme, testified that Mr. Christie was told about the closings during a ceremony to mark the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Mr. Brennan said he was in the federal courthouse listening to Mr. Wildstein testify and later obtained a transcript of his testimony to submit along with his complaint. \"Here you have a prime example of the government turning its power against the citizens, and that is the definition of totalitarianism,\" Mr. Brennan said. In New Jersey, a citizen is entitled to file a criminal complaint, which is then assessed by a judge who determines whether there is enough evidence, or probable cause, to issue a summons. If a judge fails to find probable cause, the complaint is dismissed. Citizen complaints are relatively common in New Jersey\\'s municipal courts, said J. C. Lore III, director of trial advocacy at Rutgers Law School. \"It\\'s usually reserved for more petty disputes, between family or neighbors,\" Mr. Lore said. Many such cases are resolved through mediation at the behest of the court, he said. Still, 13, 550 citizen complaints involving indictable offenses were filed in New Jersey\\'s municipal courts in 2015, and 87 percent yielded findings of probable cause, according to data provided by a court spokeswoman. Brian T. Murray, a spokesman for Mr. Christie, called Mr. Brennan\\'s complaint \"dishonorable\" and accused him of being a \"serial complainant and political activist with a history of abusing the judicial system. \" \"The simple fact is the governor had no knowledge of the lane realignments either before they happened or while they were happening,\" said Mr. Murray, who added that the governor\\'s lawyers planned to appeal the ruling. \"This matter has already been thoroughly investigated by three separate independent investigations. \" In a letter sent to Judge McGeady before he ruled on the complaint, Mr. Christie\\'s lawyers argued strenuously that Mr. Brennan had not met the probable cause threshold, calling his complaint \"rife with distortions. \" Mr. Brennan\\'s litigation history dates to 1996, when he sued the township of Teaneck, claiming he had been harassed for speaking out about safety issues, according The Record, a northern New Jersey newspaper. A jury awarded him nearly $900, 000, though a judge later reduced the amount significantly. Mr. Brennan said he earned a law degree after retiring from the Teaneck Fire Department. According to New Jersey law, obtaining a conviction of official misconduct against Mr. Christie would require proof that he deliberately refrained \"from performing a duty which is imposed upon him by law or is clearly inherent in the nature of his office,\" in order to benefit himself or harm someone else. Such a conviction would carry a potential prison sentence of five to 10 years. Maureen Parenta, a spokeswoman for the Bergen County prosecutor\\'s office, declined to comment about whether it would pursue an indictment. Gurbir S. Grewal, the acting prosecutor, was appointed by Mr. Christie.',\n",

              " 'The first cruise ship in nearly 40 years to sail across the Florida Straits from Miami to Havana docked in the Cuban capital on Monday, cutting a ribbon of water that for years was a symbol of the political gulf between the two countries. Hundreds of Cubans stood near the dock and on Havana\\'s sea wall, snapping pictures with smartphones and filming the arrival of the ship, Adonia, which arrived in the port after crossing overnight from Miami. The ship is operated by Fathom Travel, a unit of Carnival Corporation. Isabel Buznego, a passenger aboard the cruise, was born in Cuba but left about 40 years ago, when she was 5. She said she was overcome with emotion when she first spotted the fortifications that protect Havana\\'s bay. \"That really got to me,\" Ms. Buznego said. The ship\\'s arrival on Monday caused a stir among the locals, too: So thick was the crowd as the American passengers disembarked that a passing tourist asked, \"Who\\'s the celebrity?\" The cruise was the latest stage in the surge of American travel to the island since President Obama announced the normalization of relations between the United States and Cuba in December 2014. The arrival of a ship from Florida recalls the heady days before Fidel Castro\\'s 1959 revolution, when the island was a tropical getaway for Americans, and Cubans could board a ship in Havana and be in Miami within hours. Commercial sea traffic all but dried up when the United States broke off diplomatic and commercial relations with Cuba in the early 1960s. The Florida Straits became a treacherous barrier that tens of thousands of desperate Cubans crossed, or drowned trying to cross, on rafts and leaky vessels. Plans for the cruise ran into trouble in April after it emerged that it would exclude passengers because they were barred by the Cuban government from entering the country by sea. That prompted a furor in Miami and Washington, and the Cuban government lifted the restriction. Robert L. Muse, a lawyer in Washington who specializes in laws related to Cuba, said the Cuban government\\'s concession was probably driven by diplomatic considerations, not because it was concerned about lost tourism dollars. \"If it were purely about the money, they wouldn\\'t have backed down,\" Mr. Muse said. With Washington eager for the dÃ©tente to produce more commercial deals, the Cubans conceded \"to keep the dialogue afloat,\" he said. The last time an American cruise ship sailed to Cuba from the United States was in the late 1970s, during a brief thaw begun by President Jimmy Carter. Since the 2014 announcement of restored relations, several ferry and cruise companies have applied to the Treasury Department for licenses to carry American passengers to Cuba. So far, only Carnival and a French company, Ponant, have reported receiving a license to offer cruises to Cuba from American ports. The Treasury Department has issued a general license to American ferry operators, but they have yet to get permission from the Cuban authorities. For Cubans, the possibility of regular sea crossings to the United States brings the prospect of closer ties with their expatriate friends and relatives living there. Antonio Serrano, 53, a hospital worker who was watching the Adonia passengers arrive in Old Havana on Monday, said he was there to show returning Cubans that his \"solidarity is strong. \"',\n",
              " 'Conservatives would be so pissed if this actually happened.In what would perhaps be the most entertaining Supreme Court nominating process in American history, a petition is circulating asking President Obama to nominate Anita Hill to replace recently deceased Justice Antonin Scalia on the bench.Hill is most remembered for her courageous testimony against current Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas during his confirmation hearings in 1991. Hill testified that Thomas made unwanted sexual advances toward her during his stint as supervisor at the Department of Education. Despite her passing a lie detector test while he refused to take one, the Senate still confirmed Thomas 52-48 in the narrowest margin since the 1800s after other women were denied the chance to testify in support of Hill.Thomas and his conservative supporters, of course, demonized Hill, accusing her of being used by white liberals to cut down an uppity black with a high-tech lynching. But while Hill may seem to be a controversial choice to fill Scalia s seat on the high court, it s not out of the realm of possibility, nor does she lack the qualifications.Hill is an experienced attorney who also serves as University Professor of Social Policy, Law, and Women s Studies at Brandeis University. The 59-year-old attended Oklahoma State University and Yale Law School. She is one of the most prominent experts in her field and certainly possesses the legal and academic chops to serve on the Supreme Court.Furthermore, there has never been an African-American woman on the Court, which makes this an opportunity to make history with a much needed change. What better way to replace a racist misogynist like Scalia than with an educated black woman who specializes in social policy?Not only that, just imagine how uncomfortable her nomination would make Clarence Thomas feel. He d probably be sweating bullets while watching and hoping the nomination process eliminates her as the nominee. And it would be incredibly hard for conservatives to grill her without reminding the American public of how big of creep Thomas is. And if Republicans are too hard on her, they can be the ones accused of a high-tech lynching of an uppity black woman as they let their sexism and racism fly during hearings that would would likely be nationally televised and strewn across social media.And even if Hill fails to be confirmed, it would make Republicans look like the terrible lawmakers and human beings that they are, all while embarrassing the hell out of Thomas, who may even end up feeling too exposed to remain on the Court. And if she does get confirmed, he might resign anyway or at the very least be forced to watch as the woman he harassed and humiliated over 20 years ago puts on the same black robe to help the American people in a way he has refused to do throughout his own tenure. She could end up being the social justice crusader women and minorities have hoped for and become more revered than Scalia and Thomas could ever hope to be.As the petition says, Now THAT S Justice!

Some times I think candidates go to places where they think they can get their message across in a fast way, but they also diversify. They are talking to print reporters. They are talking on cable news. They are talking on social media. And they are having some appearances on some of these shows. But the bottom line is to get more people engaged and realizing about the election and what is at stake, so I think you have to factor in all of those things.\" Presidential Race Takes Over Pop Culture as Hopefuls Embrace Celebrity Status [Senior Editor] Ted Johnson Senior Editor Bernie Sanders looked exhausted as he got off a flight from Las Vegas in October at Burbank Bob Hope Airport and walked through the concourse, to be met by a reporter with a question. The query concerned the record ratings for the first Democratic debate, and Sanders gave a serious, on-message answer that tied the Nielsens to his campaign\\'s core message, saying the numbers proved that viewers are interested in \"the real crises facing the American middle class.\" An hour later, Sanders was decidedly more lighthearted, dancing on a Warner Bros. soundstage during an appearance on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show,\" where he answered questions about his hair, whether he\\'d ever been in handcuffs and his favorite member of One Direction. [ ANITA KUNZ FOR VARIETY It\\'s nothing new for candidates to gamely turn to showbiz outlets to reach the electorate. But in this crazy election cycle, what is new is the magnitude of such activity. Never has politics been so blended with entertainment. Contentious presidential debates help drive larger audiences than most new fall series; candidates are eager to take part in sketches on late-night TV and strive to be hip to pop-culture references, to sprinkle catch-phrases into their tweets and to reveal their music playlists; and celebrity surrogates are as polarizing as the candidates themselves. It\\'s a climate in which celebrity status seems to translate into political clout, and in which level of exposure is scrutinized as much as polling numbers. A carnival atmosphere has always surrounded presidential campaigns, but the mix of pop with politics has become serious business that translates to awareness, attention and adulation. MediaQuant, an analytics firm, drew headlines last month when it calculated Donald Trump \\'s \"earned media\" output â€” a dollar amount tied to the free exposure he has gotten from countless interviews, magazine covers, talk-show skits and morning-show call-in interviews. The tally was $2.4 billion â€” more than the combined total for Hillary Clinton ($947 million), Ted Cruz ($532 million) and Sanders ($480 million). By another measurement â€” exposure across hundreds of consumer publications â€” Trump and Clinton beat sports stars like Tom Brady and celebrities like Kanye West, Kim Kardashian and Justin Bieber when it comes to the value of their \"earned\" media, according to MediaQuant. \"One of the things I have gotten marginally famous for years ago was saying, \\'Politics is show business for ugly people,\\' \" says political consultant Paul Begala, chief strategist for the 1992 Clinton-Gore ticket. \"And so much more today than ever,\" he adds. \"It is becoming both more showbiz-y and more ugly.\" Take Hillary Clinton, whose cameo on \"Saturday Night Live\" drew enough of a stir that the candidate has embraced other scripted shows, including making a highly publicized appearance on Comedy Central sitcom \"Broad City.\" Her campaign has countered the news-media drumbeat of \"those damn emails\" and Goldman Sachs speeches with exposure that is humorous and self-deprecating. In March, the Clinton campaign unveiled an unusual 30-second spot on ABC that featured the stars of Shonda Rhimes\\' shows â€” and that ran the night those series aired. The network was apparently concerned enough over potential viewer confusion that it released a statement noting that \"broadcasters are required by the FCC to carry these ads.\" Cruz, whose image was heavily defined by D.C. media as the man who once helped shut down the government, made a habit of sprinkling into his speeches references to \"Star Wars,\" along with TV-born catchphrases like \"jump the shark\" and a reenactment of the \"mostly dead\" scene from \"The Princess Bride.\" Just a few months into his campaign, he appeared in a Buzzfeed video in which he did an array of impressions from \"The Simpsons.\" [ Bernie Sanders visits with \"Ellen\"; Hillary Clinton cozies up to\"Broad City\\'s\" Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson; Ted Cruz channels \"Simpsons\" characters for Buzzfeed. COURTESY OF COMEDY CENTRAL/NBC/BUZZFEED When Sanders first entered the race, he seemed so laser-focused on his core message that he couldn\\'t be bothered with offbeat questions on lifestyle topics. Last August, he scolded a New York Times writer who asked him about the scrutiny of Hillary Clinton\\'s hair vs. his. But by the time he did Ellen\\'s show, he was game to laugh. Then there\\'s Donald Trump, who entered the campaign (down an escalator) already an entertainment celebrity via \"The Apprentice,\" but one with a rather high negative \\'Q\\' score. He countered with shtick â€” a break-all-the-rules strategy in which all publicity is good publicity. In the first Republican debate, when Megyn Kelly asked him about his treatment of women, his first instinct wasn\\'t to attack the question or Kelly (although he eventually did) but to get in a nasty one-liner about Rosie O\\'Donnell. Mark McKinnon, political consultant and co-creator of Showtime\\'s \"The Circus,\" which documents the ongoing campaign, says Americans are looking to be entertained as well as informed. \"So to break through the clutter,\" he says, \"the candidates are compelled to look to nontraditional venues and formats to communicate their message. \"One thing we\\'ve learned doing \\'The Circus\\' is that voters are hungry for authenticity,\" he adds. \"They want to see what the candidates are like beyond the talking points, debates and speeches. So, alternative approaches give them an opportunity to show a side of themselves that voters rarely see but want to see. It gives voters more context and nuance for what kind of person the candidate is.\" Kristina Schake, deputy communications director for the Clinton campaign, says appearances on entertainment shows are great avenues to reach people, and have allowed the candidate to share information younger voters may not know about, such as her time at Wellesley College or with the Children\\'s Defense Fund, before she was Secretary of State. Bits on \"Saturday Night Live\" and other shows, she says, \"have been invaluable.\" \"The skit of Hillary playing Val the bartender [on \"SNL\"] and Kate McKinnon playing Hillary was one of the most talked about television appearances in terms of reach this cycle,\" Schake says. \"These moments matter because they transcend party affiliation, and everyone can enjoy them. The Secretary has enjoyed them too, and still can\\'t believe they convinced her to sing in it.\" \"One of the things I have gotten marginally famous for years ago was saying, \\'Politics is show business for ugly people.\\' And so much more today than ever. It is becoming both more showbiz-y and more ugly.\" PAUL BEGALA, POLITICAL STRATEGIST The rise in such appearances also is a function of a fragmented media universe. Amy Dacey, CEO of the Democratic National Committee, says, \"You have to go to where people are getting their information, and where people are watching. Some times I think candidates go to places where they think they can get their message across in a fast way, but they also diversify. They are talking to print reporters. They are talking on cable news. They are talking on social media. And they are having some appearances on some of these shows. But the bottom line is to get more people engaged and realizing about the election and what is at stake, so I think you have to factor in all of those things.\" Television has long been seen as an outlet to connect with voters â€” but some candidates have expressed reluctance. Almost 50 years ago, as Richard Nixon\\'s handlers carefully crafted a comeback, they convinced him to do a guest spot on \"The Mike Douglas Show,\" the soft, celebrity-driven talk show based in Philadelphia. \"You know, politics is more and more becoming show business,\" Nixon said, as he bantered over such topics as his tan with Douglas and that week\\'s co-hosts, Sandler and Young. Off camera, Nixon reportedly said, \"It\\'s a shame a man has to use gimmicks like this to get elected.\" Nine months later, having secured the Republican nomination amid the tumult of 1968, Nixon tapped pop culture again. He did the hottest show on TV, \"Laugh-In,\" in a clip that lasted just a few seconds but showed he was hip to what was hip. \"Sock it to me?\" he said, repeating the show\\'s catchphrase. \"Laugh-In\" creator George Schlatter notes that the show tried, but failed, to get rival Hubert Humphrey to appear. In the years since, candidates have tapped pop culture to varying degrees: President Gerald Ford made a pre-filmed cameo on \"Saturday Night Live\" in the midst of the 1976 primary campaign; Ronald Reagan, the first actor to become president, used a signature line from one of his movies â€” \"Go win one for the Gipper\" â€” as a call to action for his campaign; and Bill Clinton played the saxophone on \"The Arsenio Hall Show\" during the 1992 race. \"When we put Bill Clinton on \\'Arsenio Hall,\\' it was scandalous,\" Begala recalls. \"We got a ton of static. And now it is mandatory.\" Perhaps no candidate or president has been more savvy in trying to command attention through entertainment than President Obama. He was the first sitting commander-in-chief to make an in-studio appearance on a late-night talk show, when he sat down with Jay Leno on \"The Tonight Show\" less than two months after taking office. In 2013, his appearance with Zach Galifianakis on Funny or Die\\'s \"Between Two Ferns\" was credited with helping drive enrollment in Obama Care. By the time he appeared in Jerry Seinfield\\'s \"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee\" last year, any talk of whether Obama\\'s cameos are \"presidential\" had given way to discussion of whether they are laugh-out-loud funny. By the time of this year\\'s campaign, it wasn\\'t a question of whether a candidate would do late-night TV; it was how far they would go to make a mark. [ Donald Trump has been so ubiquitous in the media this campaign season, sometimes it seems like there must be more than one of him. Taran Killam and Darrell Hammond help fuel that conceit on a skit from the Trump-hosted Nov. 7 airing of \"Saturday Night Live.\" COURTESY OF NBC While late-night interviews with candidates have made news, comedic skits have made lasting impressions, like the one in which Clinton took a phone call from Trump (aka Fallon) on \"The Tonight Show,\" or when Mitt Romney read mean tweets from Trump on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live,\" or, most prominently, when Trump himself hosted \"Saturday Night Live.\" Jon Macks, a writer on Leno\\'s \"Tonight Show\" throughout its run who specializes in political humor, says that with candidates popping up all over late night, mere appearances no longer pack the punch they once did. \"It is what it is,\" he says. \"You are not going to see JFK, when he was a senator, on Jack Paar for an hour. Or John Kerry on Jay Leno having a legitimate and smart conversation about policies. You see it once in a while, but not to the degree you have seen it in the past.\" Part of the reason is the drive for skits that will travel virally â€” not necessarily a desire to succinctly convey a policy position. \"In a world defined by six-second Vines, the eight-second sound bite seems like the Gettysburg Address,\" Macks says. \"The candidates are entertainment in and of themselves,\" he adds. \"When candidates go on \\'Jimmy Fallon,\\' they are not going on to position themselves with the electorate. They are going on to be part of a skit. They are not doing a bit to lead to some big policy discussion. It is entertainment as pure entertainment.\" For the few candidates who balk, the alternative is to be out-entertained. Dave Berg, co-producer of Leno\\'s \"Tonight Show,\" was a supporter of Marco Rubio and urged the campaign to maximize opportunities on late night. Instead, he said, the campaign squandered its chances: Rubio\\'s appearance on \"The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon\" in January, for instance, turned out to be unmemorable. Berg calls the interview \"substandard,\" and wonders why the Rubio campaign didn\\'t try to tap further into pop culture, given the candidate\\'s telegenic personality and youth. When candidates do try comedy, the right choices are \"very, very important,\" Berg says, even though such appearances are typically short on policy details. \"It is important that you get the right sketch. If it is the wrong sketch, it can be disastrous.\" When Kerry appeared on \"Leno\" during the 2004 campaign, he insisted on riding in on a motorcycle. The result, says Berg, \"reminded me of Dukakis riding in the tank with a helmet on.\" Candidates almost always have veto power over a sketch. \"Some of our writers would write 10 bits that would be rejected by the candidates,\" Berg recalls. \"Our writers couldn\\'t stand Al Gore. His people would reject bit after bit, even though they were going to vote for him.\" Still, rarely were candidates unwilling to do any routine at all, he says. \"One thing I have learned about people in the political world, and also about commentators and journalists: In each and every one of these people is a comedian dying to get out.\" Actor Mark Ruffalo, an activist-actor who is backing Sanders, believes authenticity is the key to successfully connecting with voters via entertainment platforms. He notes that his son\\'s favorite shows are on YouTube, featuring user-generated celebrities, because \"it has a credibility to it. There is no artifice. \"When candidates go on \\'Jimmy Fallon,\\' they are not going on to position themselves with the electorate. They are going on to be part of a skit. It is entertainment as pure entertainment.\" JON MACKS, WRITER \"It is reaching people in ways that the mainstream media can\\'t, for one,\" he adds. \"It is a direct line to your constituency. There is no middle man.\" Such a targeted connection is important, he says, because of the way people consume media. \"We live in this era of decentralization,\" he explains. \"The entertainment industry is decentralizing. The news is decentralizing. What you are seeing is politicians finally realizing it is a way of reaching people that feels less artificial.\" Earlier this month, Clinton ended Trump\\'s dominance of one audience metric when she surpassed him in weekly YouTube views, according to video identification tech firm Zefr. A reason: The clip of her struggle to use a New York subway card was a big draw, with more than 1 million views. Begala points out that as much as we\\'ve seen the fusion of campaigns and entertainment, what we have yet to witness this cycle is a breakthrough viral hit on the order of Will.i.am\\'s 2008 \"Yes, We Can\" video, which featured Obama\\'s New Hampshire primary speech and went on to post more than 20 million hits on YouTube. \"That was groundbreaking,\" Begala says. \"I think you will get that, but it has to be organic. It can\\'t be forced by some political consultant like me.\" There has been unique user-generated content. Cruz\\'s obsession with \"Star Wars\" inspired a video â€” \"The Constitution Strikes Back,\" with Cruz as a Jedi warrior â€” created by producer Joel Gilbert. Gilbert made the video independently of the campaign â€” although Cruz\\'s team did tweet it out after it was posted. Gilbert says he saw a need for something that could do more to market Cruz\\'s image and background, particularly to younger voters, given that the candidate is 45 and now the youngest in the race. \"Generally these Republican strategists, who have been running campaigns for years, don\\'t have much of an affinity of how powerful pop culture can be,\" Gilbert says. As much as showbiz is intrinsic to politics, the downside is when theatrics overshadow serious thinking. One of the more telling quotes from the current candidates came from Trump, who discussed his media ubiquity with Time in March. \"I go on one of these shows, and the ratings double,\" he said. \"They triple. And that gives you power. It\\'s not the polls. It\\'s the ratings.\" RELATED [1952: On Sept. 23, vice presidential candidate Richard Nixon responds to accusations of financial improprieties on national TV, vowing to keep his dog Checkers no matter what, and garnering the largest television audience at that time.] Politics and Pop Culture: Top Moments in History Star Jones, former co-host of \"The View,\" who has been a surrogate for Clinton, says that the vitriol of this campaign is a contrast to previous cycles. \"It is almost as if we have gone to the reality-show world of politics.\" That is especially true when it comes to celebrities entering the political area â€” and 2016 is destined to define the limits of that success. Fred Grandy, who ran for Congress and won in 1986, two years after starring in \"The Love Boat,\" says that Trump is running up against the public\\'s desire for the next act. The billionaire spent the time after his wins on Super Tuesday and his loss in Wisconsin going from one reality-show-like flap to another. \"He has not been able to take the enormous advantage that celebrity confers upon you, and deepen that into a kind of gravitas and wisdom that gives people a certain comfort level,\" Grandy says. Trump\\'s recent win in New York helped him rebound, but he still faces high unfavorable polling numbers. The candidate, Grandy adds, has seized on two key issues, immigration and trade, and has capitalized on his ability to stage a show. \"Donald Trump has a speaking cadence that is somewhat between standup and rap, but people like that. It is talking to somebody and not down to somebody.\" Still, at a certain point voters will want assurance that candidates will be presidential. \"Trump has had popularity,\" Grandy says. \"It doesn\\'t mean it is a love affair. It\\'s an infatuation.\" From: Garcia, Walter Sent: Friday, April 15, 2016 2:33 PM To: Wei, Shu-Yen Cc: Manriquez, Pablo; Comm_D Subject: RE: Dacey Courts AAPI Voters in Los Angeles A little late, but here\\'s one more article: DNC REACHING OUT TO ASIAN AMERICAN VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA By Steve Angeles, Balitang America The 2016 presidential election is seven months away. Issues continue, the race for the Democratic presidential nomination is getting more heated than expected, and Asian American voters are being courted. One of those reaching out is Amy Dacey. The CEO of the Democratic National Committee recently visited Californiaâ€“the state with the most Asian Americansâ€“holding a round table with the media and meeting with local communities. Dacey said they saw a record turnout from Asian Americans in support of President Obama in 2012. She also said 4.5 million Asian Americans are now 18 and were able to register to vote in 2012. \"I do think they can have a strong voice in this election, and I do think what you\\'re seeing are issues that they do care about,\" said Dacey. \"That\\'s why we\\'re doing a lot of outreach right now, myself, we are doing this swing through.\" Dacey said the DNC is continuing to reach out to Asian Americans and the Asian Pacific Islander community through various groups and community organizations. They also correspond with weekly papers, radio stations and social media to spread information. When it comes to the election cycles, primaries and nominations are often wrapped up before California\\'s June primaries but this time, with Bernie Sanders gaining some momentum against Hillary Clinton, there is a possibility that the Golden State can play a role in the Democratic race. \"Both candidates were recently here,\" she said. \"Whether it was a big rally, talked to individuals and had a very serious speech that secretary Clinton gave about the importance of what\\'s happening in our foreign policy, I think that clearly shows they\\'re invested in California.\" Leaders from both parties have come out to Los Angeles to do their own outreach. Jason Chung, national director of the Asian Pacific American Initiatives for the Republican National Committee also came to California for outreach efforts. He joined Dacey at the Asian American justice conference, where they were part of a panel that unveiled new polling data on California\\'s Asian American voters. Data showed that no matter the partyâ€“Democrat, Republican, or Independentâ€“the state\\'s Asian American voters have similar priorities. Immigration, education and health care are issues that are expected to bring them to the ballot boxes.

DNC Chief Executive Officer Amy Dacey told reporters yesterday (Wednesday in Manila) they have expanded their grassroots outreach to members of the nation\\'s fastest-growing ethnic group. \"We\\'re looking at how we\\'re communicating with themâ€¦and how they\\'re getting their information about the party, what we stand for, the general election and our candidates,\" Dacey said in a roundtable discussion with the media in downtown Los Angeles. \"We\\'re working on the local level everyday to do that. Peer-to-peer conversation, people hearing from members of their community matters a lot.\" Studies show AAPIs will soon outnumber Latinos as the largest immigrant group coming to the United States. While AAPIs are concentrated in California and New York, they are also rapidly growing in the battleground states of Nevada, Virginia, and Florida. That means capturing the Asian American vote is important in the November elections, according to the Asian American Advancing Justice, which is set to release new polling data on AAPIs today (Thursday in Manila). In the last few presidential elections, Fil-Ams and other AAPIs had leaned heavily democrat, and the DNC hopes to get more of them to vote. \"The issues that (Democrats) are focusing on are very tuned in to the Filipino-American community, especially the issues ofimmigration and health care,\" said Fil-Am Fritz Friedman, former Sony Pictures senior vice president of worldwide publicity who serves on the credentials committee for DNC\\'s national convention this July in Philadelphia. \"Also, the Democratic Party is much more inclusive. They understand people of color, as opposed to Republicans (who), in my opinion, are not as sensitive to the interests of the ethnic minorities in this country.\" Dacey said she\\'s confident the party will have a presidential nominee before the national convention and that nominee will win the race for the White House. \"I am confident that one of our candidates will be the 45th president of the United States,\" said Dacey, who is scheduled to meet with party leaders in California. She declined to say who she thought would be the presidential nominee. \"Both (Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders) have run campaigns that are worthy of the office of the president,\" she said.

              " '\"From the start,\" Hillary Clinton declared today in Reno, \"Donald Trump has built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia. He has taken hate groups mainstream, and [is] helping a radical fringe take over the Republican Party.\" The speech that followed those words was an extended argument that her opponent is a racist, a conspiracy theorist, and a man temperamentally unfit to be president. Clinton\\'s campaign had promoted this in advance as an address about \"Donald Trump and his advisors\\' embrace of the disturbing \\'alt-right\\' political philosophy\"â€”the alt-right being an umbrella term for an assortment of racist micro-movements and online subcultures. Yesterday I suggested that making the alt-right the stars of such a speech could only give a signal boost to what is, after all, a rather obscure political faction. But Clinton\\'s comments about that faction took up only about a minute of her remarks. And while that minute was pretty juicy, the alt-right wasn\\'t really the rally\\'s star villain after all. The star villain was Donald Trump. Everyone else that Clinton brought into the addressâ€”the alt-right, Breitbart, Alex Jones, David Duke, Nigel Farage, Vladimir Putinâ€”was there in a supporting role. Some of Clinton\\'s arguments didn\\'t make a lot of sense. She led her litany, oddly, by quoting Trump\\'s recent remarks about how bad blacks have it in America. (\"Poverty. Rejection. Horrible education. No housing. No homes. No ownership. Crime at levels nobody has seen.\") Most people would call his comments a clumsy attempt to reassure voters that he cares about the black community\\'s problems, but Clinton declared them \"a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters.\" She also wildly overstated the alt-right\\'s influence, declaring that \"the de facto merger between Breitbart and the Trump campaign\" means the alt-rightists have \"effectively taken over the Republican Party.\" She was on sturdier ground at other moments, as when she mentioned Trump\\'s habit of retweeting white nationalists or his false claim that he watched thousands of New Jersey Muslims cheer the 9/11 attacks. Running through all her claims, both the weak ones and the strong ones, was one basic theme: Donald Trump is a bigot and a nut. And while that\\'s an idea you\\'ve been hearing ever since the mogul turned reality TV star entered the race, this was as forceful and concentrated an expression of it as I\\'ve ever heard emerge from Hillary Clinton\\'s mouth. It\\'s bound to fire up her supporters, and I expect it will help her get out the vote. Whether it also leads a bunch of curious conservatives to Google \"alt-right\" depends, I suppose, on how much coverage that minute of the speech gets in the next few days. But the guy who must be really delighted right now is Alex Jones. Hillary Clinton just attacked him by name! His listeners will be hearing clips from this speech til Ragnarok.',\n",

              " 'The Senate passed the first broad energy bill in nine years on Wednesday, legislation containing modest measures popular with both Republicans and Democrats to modernize the power grid and speed the permitting process for liquefied natural gas exports. The bill, which passed 85-12, attempts to protect the power grid from extreme weather events such as ice storms and hurricanes, and from cyber attacks. It also aims to spur innovations in storage of power from wind and solar energy. The House of Representatives passed a similar bill last year. The Energy Policy and Modernization Act would increase U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG), eventually helping to give European consumers alternatives to relying mainly on Russia for gas. After disagreements held the bill up for months, senators last week dropped measures from the bill to aid Flint, Michigan overcome a drinking water crisis, in which children have been exposed to dangerous levels of lead, and on offshore drilling. Lawmakers from both the House and Senate will next iron out differences over the bill. The Senate bill, for instance, requires the Department of Energy to issue a decision on LNG projects within 45 days of an environmental assessment, while the House bill directs the DOE to make the decision on permits after 30 days. Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington state who co-sponsored the bill, said shortly before it passed that she hoped the chambers would move quickly \"so that we can realize the opportunity to help our businesses and consumers plan for the energy future.\" The White House has signaled that President Barack Obama would sign the Senate bill. Energy policy analyst Kevin Book of ClearView Energy Partners said the chances the bill would be signed into law this year were about 65 percent, because the White House has had some differences with the House bill. Charlie Riedl, the head of industry group the Center for Liquefied Natural Gas, said the vote was a \"big step forward\" and that certainty about the regulatory process is \"crucial\" for projects that cost billions of dollars to build. Rob Cowin, director of government affairs at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit group, said the bill falls \"far short\" of what is needed to promote wind and solar power, but is \"better than doing nothing.\" The Senate on Tuesday passed several amendments to the bill, including restricting most sales from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve when oil prices are low.',\n",

              " 'Six years of war in Syria have ravaged the life of Ebrahim Abbas, 27. Mr. Abbas, a computer technician, was detained for protesting against the Syrian government, besieged in his hometown and shot in the stomach, and watched his brother die in a shelling attack. He escaped, but his father, a diabetic, died later from a lack of medicine, and his mother was killed by a sniper. It was from his refuge in Turkey that Mr. Abbas heard about President Trump\\'s decision to launch 59 cruise missiles at a Syrian air base to punish President Bashar for a chemical weapons attack. It felt good. \"Watching a world power taking revenge for civilians against the Syrian regime gave me a surge of hope and made me a bit optimistic,\" Mr. Abbas said. But the attack will not bring back all that he has lost nor help him return home soon. In a measure of how entrenched the war is, there were new airstrikes on Saturday on the town targeted in the attack, with at least one person killed, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The strike on the air base was the most direct, deliberate military intervention by the United States against Mr. Assad\\'s forces since the war began. Mr. Trump said he had launched the strike because he was moved by images of women and children choking on poison gas. \"That was a horrible, horrible thing,\" he told reporters after the chemical attack. \"And I\\'ve been watching it and seeing it, and it doesn\\'t get any worse than that. \" But while the strike on Thursday appeared intended to limit the chances of retaliation, Mr. Trump has offered no proposals to end the war or to assuage the vast human suffering it has generated, sending fleeing Syrians across the globe. Yasmine Mashaan, a pharmacy technician from the town of Muhassan in eastern Syria who lost several brothers to the conflict, said the strike was unlikely to change much for her and her family. And she doubts Mr. Trump\\'s motivations. \"It would be great if he continued this in the direction of saving more civilians or establishing a safe zone, but after his racist speeches and policy, I think the strike is more for popularity,\" said Ms. Mashaan, who is now in Germany after fleeing there with her family. \"But judging by how fast he intervened in Syria and how powerful it was, then we might be going somewhere with it. \" The number affected by the conflict boggles the mind. What began as an uprising in 2011 escalated into a civil war as protesters took up arms to respond to the government\\'s repression and seek its ouster. Over time, countries like the United States, Turkey and Saudi Arabia backed the rebels, while Russia and Iran helped Mr. Assad. As chaos spread, extremist groups gained ground. Al Qaeda infiltrated the rebel movement, while the jihadists of the Islamic State seized territory that extended into Iraq. Now more than 400, 000 people have been killed, a figure roughly equal to the population of Tulsa, Okla. or Oakland, Calif. Many more have been maimed. Half of Syria\\'s prewar population of 22 million have fled their homes, a number close to the population of Belgium. Five million of those are registered refugees abroad, according to the United Nations. Most are in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, where 70 percent live on less than $3. 84 a day, less than the cost of some lattes at Starbucks. Jan Egeland, the secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, which does aid work in Syria, said he could not comment for or against the strike by the United States, but he said that \"they do not solve any of my urgent priorities. \" For the humanitarian situation to improve, aid workers would need more border crossings for getting aid into the country, assurances that air and ground forces would not attack hospitals and better access to besieged and suffering communities, including nearly 400, 000 people within an hour\\'s drive of Damascus, the capital. \"It is heartbreakingly frustrating to be a humanitarian worker and to have the resources and the supplies but not to be able to reach these people,\" Mr. Egeland said. Within the conflict\\'s statistics are countless stories of torture, detention, forced conscription, families torn apart and normal lives downgraded rapidly or simply cut short. Even some Syrians who welcomed the strike questioned why, after all of the war\\'s brutality, it was the chemical attack this past week that had brought a show of force against Mr. Assad. \"Of course chemicals are weapons of mass destruction,\" said a doctor east of Damascus who treated victims of the first major chemical attack in Syria, in 2013. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared government reprisal. \"But what about sieges? What about killing children? Isn\\'t it wrong for children to grow up without knowing Tom and Jerry? Without knowing chocolate?\" President Barack Obama did not respond militarily to a chemical attack in 2013, despite having called the use of such weapons a \"red line. \" Since then, the doctor has watched the world move on while the siege of his area has tightened, he said through Skype. He said he had learned to live with less electricity, less fuel, less clean water and less food. \"We are living like ancient people, how they depended on themselves, how they used wood to make fires,\" he said. \"It is a hard life. \" He expected more from the United States and its allies after the 2013 attack, what he called \"a position that was appropriate for the free world. \" But the result was an agreement, brokered by Russia, for Mr. Assad to give up his chemical weapons. \"The solution to the crime was a deal to take away the weapon but leave the criminal,\" the doctor said. The strike by the United States made him mildly optimistic that Mr. Trump would intervene more forcefully than Mr. Obama had. \"Trump is a closed box that has started to open,\" he said. \"Soon we will see what\\'s inside. \" While conflict monitors said that Mr. Assad\\'s forces and their allies had caused the bulk of the war\\'s deaths with their advanced weapons, communities loyal to Mr. Assad have also paid a heavy price. Tens of thousands of Syrian soldiers have been killed, and religious minorities, secularists and others who view Mr. Assad as a symbol of a unified Syria have continued to fight out of fear that they would be eradicated if Islamist rebels take over the country. Others have had to face both the government and the jihadists. Ms. Mashaan, the pharmacy technician, said her family\\'s troubles began when she intervened to stop a security officer from beating her brother for protesting. The officer beat her instead, breaking her arm. As the uprising spread, Ms. Mashaan, 36, and her five brothers joined in. Soon, her brothers and husband were arrested and tortured, in some cases coming home with their fingernails removed, she said. Then they began to die. One was killed when security forces fired into a crowd of protesters, she said. Another was shot in their home by a sniper. Yet another disappeared. She later recognized his face in a trove of photos of bodies smuggled out of a prison near Damascus. As violence spread, Ms. Mashaan\\'s family fled to a refugee camp in the countryside, but it was soon taken over by a new force in the area: Islamic State jihadists. They killed her younger brother and took advantage of her medical training by forcing her to work in a clinic, she said. The family later fled to a refugee camp across the border in Turkey, where they lived until Ms. Mashaan\\'s husband and her last remaining brother joined the migration to Europe and paid smugglers to take them to Greece in rubber dinghies. They made their way to Germany, where she and her five children joined them last year. Living in Germany is hard, she said in a Facebook chat from her new home.

The United States is concerned that Iran, a Shi ite regional power, will take advantage of gains against IS in Iraq and Syria to expand the influence it gained after the U.S. invasion in 2003, something Sunni Arab rivals such as Riyadh also oppose. Iranian militias that are in Iraq, now that the fight against Daesh and ISIS is coming to a close, those militias need to go home. The foreign fighters in Iraq need to go home and allow the Iraqi people to regain control, Tillerson said at a joint news conference with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Jubeir. Tens of thousands of Iraqis heeded a call to arms in 2014 after IS seized a third of the country s territory, forming the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), which receive funding and training from Tehran and have been declared part of the Iraqi security apparatus. A senior U.S. official said Tillerson had been referring to the PMF and the Quds Force, the foreign paramilitary and espionage arm of the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif berated Tillerson s remarks as influenced by Iran s oil-rich regional rival Saudi Arabia. Exactly what country is it that Iraqis who rose up to defend their homes against ISIS return to?, Zarif said in a tweet. Shameful US FP (foreign policy), dictated by petrodollars. Iraq s military, armed by the United States but supported by the PMF, ejected the ultra-hardline Sunni Muslim militant group from Mosul and other cities in northern Iraq this year. Several thousand U.S. troops are still in the country, mostly for training but also to carry out raids against IS. The campaign to uproot the militants left whole cities in ruins and has hit Iraq s economy. A new joint ministerial-level body between Iraq and Saudi Arabia convened its inaugural meeting earlier on Sunday to coordinate their fight against IS and on rebuilding Iraqi territory wrested from the group. Jubeir emphasized historic ties between the two neighbors, which share a border, vast oil resources and many of the same tribes. The natural tendency of the two countries and people is to be very close to each other as they have been for centuries. It was interrupted for a number of decades. We re trying now to make up for lost ground, he said. The rare senior meeting, signaling a thaw between states that have been at loggerheads for decades, was also attended by Saudi King Salman and Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. Tillerson said the council would contribute to reforms to build Iraq s private sector and encourage foreign investment. This will be critical to winning the peace that has been earned through the hard-fought military gains, he said. State media said the council had expressed satisfaction with global oil markets recovery as a result of a deal with other countries to boost prices by limiting production. The council also agreed to reopen a Saudi Basic Industries Corp office in Iraq and grant Saudi agriculture company SALIC an investment license. A second meeting will be held in Baghdad but no date was mentioned. Saudi Commerce and Investment Minister Majid al-Qusaibi told Reuters his country seeks to boost exports and is eyeing investment opportunities in Iraq s agricultural and petrochemical sectors, among others. He said backing from the highest levels of both governments would produce quick results on the ground . Let s not cry over spilt milk. Whatever happened in the past has happened. The good news is we are all here toward building a prosperous and beneficial future for both countries, he said in a telephone interview. Tillerson and Jubeir also discussed Washington s hawkish new policy towards Iran, including a possible withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal and new sanctions on the IRGC. Both our countries believe those who conduct business with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, any of their entities, European companies or other companies around the world really do so at great risk, Tillerson said. Relations between Riyadh and Baghdad were cut for 25 years, before recent rapprochement, after former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990. Saudi Arabia, along with the United Arab Emirates, is wooing Baghdad now in an effort to halt the growing regional influence of Iran. Arriving in Doha later on Sunday for the next leg of a multi-country trip, Tillerson told a news conference that there was little chance of a swift breakthrough to resolve a blockade imposed on Qatar by Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies. The kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain imposed trade and travel curbs on Doha in June for alleged support of terrorism and friendship with Iran - charges Qatar denies. There is not a strong indication that the parties are ready to talk yet, Tillerson said. The secretary of state s six-day trip will also take him to Pakistan, India and Switzerland.',\n",

              " 'Now that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has crossed the Rubicon of racism, the people are starting to lash out, and rightfully so.After disqualifying the Trump University judge because of his race, Republicans and Democrats alike have been holding Trump s feet to the fire some more so than others. Most Republicans have simply disavowed his comments while some have flat out called him a fraud (and of course Democrats have been saying these things since June of last year).But the most glaring critique from any official came from Democratic Representative Filemon Vela of Texas, who penned a scathing open letter to Trump. Starting out by agreeing that Mexico should do more to deter cartel violence, Vela quickly amps up his attack, saying, Your ignorant anti-immigrant opinions, your border wall rhetoric, and your recent bigoted attack on an American jurist are just plain despicable. Pretty standard criticism. But it gets so much better. Vela beats Trump at his own purity game, and notes that his ancestry is more American than Trump s, and that his family weren t chicken hawks: Before you dismiss me as just another Mexican, let me point out that my great-great grandfather came to this country in 1857, well before your own grandfather. His grandchildren (my grandfather and his brothers) all served our country in World War I and World War II. His great-grandson, my father, served in the U.S. Army and, coincidentally, was one of the first Mexican federal judges ever appointed to the federal bench. But the most telling and poignant line from Vela s letter was a good, old fashioned smackdown: Mr. Trump, you re a racist and you can take your border wall and shove it up your ass. This is by far the best response to Trump from any elected official. You know they all want to say it, but finally someone had the guts to actually come out and do it.And that s exactly what Donald Trump can do. Even if he were to be elected, there is no feasible way a wall would be built on the Mexican border and be financed by the Mexican government.Vela represents Texas 34th Congressional District, which makes up Corpus Christie and Brownsville. According to Census data, 60 percent of Corpus Christie s population is of Hispanic or Latino descent. In Brownsville, a border city, the Hispanic/Latino population accounted for 93 percent of its citizens.The proud people of Hispanic and Latino heritage of Texas 34th district can take solace in knowing they are being represented by a man who speaks for them to the fullest extent.

              " \"When I saw Meryl Streep play the seemingly facile Omaha housewife she portrays in this 2012 marital dramedy, I had an immediate flashback to an underrated romantic drama she did almost thirty years ago, Ulu Grosbard's (1984), in which she played a young married woman who couldn't help falling for a married architect (Robert De Niro) on a commuter train. I kept thinking of Kay as that earlier character all these years later trying to fan the embers of the passion that erupted so unpredictably back then. Interestingly, her younger character could not consummate the affair either but fell hopelessly in love anyway. Director David Frankel () and first-time screenwriter Vanessa Taylor travel to the opposite end of the marital spectrum, a 31-year-old marriage that finds Kay and her accountant husband Arnold sleeping in separate bedrooms having long ago lost any sense of intimacy and passion their marriage once had. The film begins with a seriocomic preface in which Kay awkwardly tries to seduce Arnold, an invitation he rebuffs with the flimsiest of excuses. Knowing their marriage is on auto-pilot, she fears being alone emotionally and ending their lives in emotional isolation now as they go through the motions in their sixties. An optimist despite the odds, Kay signs them up for a week of intensive couples therapy in Great Hope Springs, Maine, where renowned therapist Dr. Bernie Feld practices. Arnold is predictably resistant but begrudgingly accompanies her when he realizes how serious Kay is about the counseling. The sessions with Dr. Feld initially don't go well with Arnold protesting the doctor's every recommendation for building intimacy in his relationship with Kay. This is when the movie becomes the most surprising because every time a physically awkward moment presents itself, the feelings become heartfelt and sometimes humorous in unexpected ways. While Frankel and Taylor handle the slim story turns with genuine insight, it's the masterful work of Streep and Tommy Lee Jones that elevates the film into an experience that far transcends the Lifetime-TV orientation you would expect otherwise. Unafraid to come across as harshly judgmental, Jones has made a career of playing dyspeptic curmudgeons, so it's nice to see him gradually reveal Arnold's vulnerabilities with skill and delicacy. He has to play Arnold close to the vest but not so insular as to make you wonder what Kay saw in him in the first place. After tackling larger-than-life figures like Julia Child and Margaret Thatcher, Streep is splendid portraying a sheltered woman who contributes as much to the fossilized, inchoate marriage as Arnold does. At 63, the actress allows herself to look even beyond her age, but she's still beautiful in a shopworn way. I love how she almost swallows every word she speaks as if Kay's tentative nature is holding back grand expectations of a romance she can only fantasize about. The two veteran actors have a natural rapport that gives the viewer a rooting interest in seeing them overcome their age-old emotional and physical barriers. There are moments between them especially in the film's last third that are quite heartbreaking, especially when they come to learn that they aren't the people they believed themselves, or each other, to be. Steve Carell plays Feld straight-up without an iota of irony, and his clinical approach works effectively within this context. The rest of the supporting cast makes very little impact, including Jean Smart as Kay's sassy manager at the Coldwater Creek she works part-time, Elisabeth Shue as an equally sassy barmaid counseling Kay on sex, and Mimi Rogers as the final payoff of a joke about a comely (and yes, sassy) neighbor with a trio of corgis. The young actors who play Kay and Arnold's adult children are barely present, but I'm sure that was part of the intention in order to allow complete focus on the couple. Frankel overdoes the soundtrack music when moments of silence would have been far more effective, but otherwise, the tone feels spot-on.\",\n",

It s also drawing those who believe the GOP s policies are a major departure from what this country was supposed to be, despite all their claims that they want us to be exactly that. Because of that, the Freedom From Religion Foundation has a billboard up near their venue with a quote from none other than St. Reagan himself, and conservatives will absolutely despise it.This is the billboard below:FFRF quotes Reagan in Cleveland message to GOP convention https://t.co/MIkpBehtQv pic.twitter.com/6EGURARKW7 FFRF (@FFRF) June 27, 2016The point is clear: Keep church and state separate.Over the last couple of decades, Republicans have worked hard to entangle civil law with biblical law, and they hope to keep us from knowing the difference. Pea-brains like Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, James Inhofe, and more allow their religions to have a stranglehold on their policy decisions. The GOP itself has taken the Establishment Clause to mean that Christians should be free to do whatever they want to whomever they want, but all other religions need to put up with being restricted, and shut up altogether.The FFRF has been working to keep church and state separate since 1978, and this billboard is a brilliant idea because it takes a quote from one of the GOP s own idols and turns it back on them. Some places, like The Blaze, have already claimed that the quote is taken out of context, which is nonsense. The full quote is: Our very unity has been strengthened by our pluralism. We establish no religion in this country, we command no worship, we mandate no belief, nor will we ever. Church and state are, and must remain, separate. All are free to believe or not believe, all are free to practice a faith or not, and those who believe are free, and should be free, to speak of and act on their belief. That s in no way taken out of context. Instead, it s basically a summary of what Reagan was saying. Furthermore, Reagan s own son, Ron Reagan Jr., is on the Honorary Board of Distinguished Thinkers at the FFRF, and is an atheist who isn t afraid to burn in hell. There s little question he supports this display.It s actually the hateful, judgmental, narrow-minded Christians of the religious right who don t want to follow the Constitution, and they re dragging the GOP along with them, all in the name of following the Constitution. It s long past time for the GOP to stop pandering to the evangelicals and actually try to govern according to the Constitution, like they keep insisting they are.Featured image by Win McNamee/Getty Images',\n",

              " 'We bought this for our outdoor plants before we disappeared for a week to a vacation. At that time, weather here was dry and hot and no rain was forecast for the whole week, so we needed to provide the plants with some water. The watering system worked as it should - when we came back, the plants were alive and looked rather well. Set-up of the system is very easy, but due to the limited length of the water hose, you either need to compile your plants within the reach of this unit, or you have to buy more than one unit. Our plants that needed the week long water treatment are all moveable, so we clustered them in an area of approximately 5 by 5 feet directly adjacent to the solar unit, which we attached to a rain pipe with the provided plastic bands. Of course, being solar powered, it is paramount that the unit has access to sunlight, but in pour case this was only true for maybe four hours a day in the afternoon. Still, this and the rechargeable batteries you need to put in (not provided!) kept the unit going. Another consideration is the flow rate of the water, which can be chosen variably. But the more water you let flow through the system, the bigger your tank has to be. Not everybody has a 50 gallon drum readily available, and we eventually had to settle for an old 20 gallon plastic container. we set the flow rate to a very low level and calculated that this would do the trick. It did. When we came back, the container was only half empty and our precious hibiscus and the other plants were in great shape. So, this is certainly not a 1-2-3 solution - it needs a bit planning and preparation with placement, water supply and flow rate, but once you have figured it all out, it works perfectly. We did not bother to remove the system after we got back from our vacation, but left it - and the plants - in place. It just looked good the way the plants were arranged - though more out of necessity than of aesthetic reasons at first - andthe solar powered unit, after over one month of constant use, still supplies them with a steady stream of water. Out of our experience, we can highly recommend this product.',\n",

              " 'Barack Obama and the Democrat Party were laser focused on opening the immigrant floodgates for 8 years. They re the first ones to cry when President Trump mentions budget cuts to schools and programs for the elderly, but what about the enormous burden millions of new immigrants (mostly illegal) have put on the backs of taxpayers? The Democrats were only looking at immigrants as voters, they didn t consider how the massive influx of people on entitlement programs would affect our schools and social programs. The statistics below are stunning:Children of immigrants, many in the United States illegally, make up the bulk of students in 700 of the biggest school areas, a huge and unexpected wave that is changing education and society in America, according to a groundbreaking new report.Using Census Bureau statistics and Google Maps, the Center for Immigration Studies found that in areas including northern Virginia, New York City and Houston, children of immigrants made up to 93 percent of all students. The number of children from immigrant households in schools is now so high in some areas that it raises profound questions about assimilation, said the report provided to Secrets. What s more, immigration has added enormously to the number of public school students who are in poverty and the number who speak a foreign language. This cannot help but to create significant challenges for schools, often in areas already struggling to educate students who come from disadvantaged backgrounds, it added.Overall, 23 percent of all public school students were from an immigrant household in 2015. In 1990 it was 11 percent, and in 1980 it was 7 percent.And, said the CIS report, between one-fourth and one-third of public school students from immigrant households were the children of illegal immigrants. Report author Steven Camarota said, Of course, we must educate the children of immigrants. But, added the Center s director of research, the key question moving forward is whether it makes sense to continue to admit 1 million new legal permanent immigrants each year and tolerating illegal immigration without regard to the absorption capacity of our schools in terms of both educating students and assimilating them. On a state level, he found that California has the biggest percentage of immigrant students in public schools, 48 percent, followed by Nevada, 35 percent, New Jersey and New York at 34 percent, and Texas, 31 percent.The bulk have Mexican or El Salvadoran parents.He also found that many immigrant families are poor, which cuts the tax base schools have to tap for funds.',\n",

              " \"I would certainly recommend this to those looking to lose weight or those looking to tone their core. Quite simply it works! I can tell you that this ab wheel is a good price compared to those in store models and its good quality, I have had no issues with it despite tons of use. I've been trying to lose weight for six months now and have made pretty good progress. As with any weight loss program it all comes down to eating right, exercising and supplements. Ive never been good at going to the gym so I decided to buy products like this so I can easily workout at my house. So my routine includes pullups, resistance band exercises, pushups and cardio. The cardio helps me to get in shape and burn fat, I usually do some sprints/intervals or some longer distance running. the exercise bands, pushups and pullups help to build muscle and define the muscle. And then the ab wheel helps with my core, keeping a strong core is very important in running as well as just normal day life. I work at a desk so ad exercises help a ton with keeping good posture in a very sedentary job. The ab wheel is NOT easy, I know some people may see it and think they wont get a workout but if you do it right and keep good form you will most certainly feel it. After the first few times using it I was sore for the next day! NOT easy. But if you want results thats what you need. On top of my current workout needs i have also been eating healthy. This healthy eating is mainly towards losing weight so thats the focus of many of my habits. For instance upon waking up I drink a protein shake and eat a banana for breakfast, protein is great in the morning when you are trying to lose weight. 30g within 30 min of waking up is ideal. In total I stick to about 2200 calories a day and try and stay away from processed foods although sometimes it is tough. I also take a supplement called which help you lose more weight by burning more fat and raising your metabolism. That combined with the protein shake in the morning help a ton. The protein also has the effect of keeping you fuller longer which helps me make it to lunch time without craving snacks.\",\n",

As North Korea has defied U.N. Security resolutions to conduct nuclear and ballistic missile tests, Washington has been scrambling for an effective response. Many of President Donald Trump s fellow Republicans have been calling for tougher action, imposed more quickly, including calling for stiff secondary sanctions and other punishments for companies, banks and countries that do business with North Korea. In a letter seen by Reuters that will be sent to ambassadors from China and 20 other countries, Republican Senator Cory Gardner, the subcommittee chairman, asked that the countries immediately end diplomatic and economic relations with Pyongyang. Maintaining official diplomatic relations with a regime that continues to defy international law and threaten nations across the globe only serves to reward nefarious behavior, wrote Gardner. In addition to cutting off bilateral ties, I urge your government to support expelling the DPRK from the United Nations, the letter said. Gardner recently introduced legislation that would impose a U.S. economic embargo against any entity that does business with North Korea. The U.S. military staged bombing drills with South Korea over the Korean peninsula and Russia and China began naval exercises ahead of a U.N.

              " 'Poverty is entrenched in the Mississippi city of Durant (population less than 3, 000) but violent crime is hardly pervasive. The Police Department website lists current statistics of one report each for lost property, theft and a harassing phone call. It has been years since Durant, which is about 65 miles north of Jackson, last recorded a murder, the authorities said. But on Thursday, that sense of community and security was torn apart after two beloved nuns who worked at a medical clinic in a nearby town were found killed in their Durant home. The nuns were identified as Sister Margaret M. Held and Sister Paula J. Merrill, 68. The women were nurse practitioners who worked about 20 miles away at the Lexington Medical Clinic. Durant\\'s assistant police chief, James Lee, said an officer was sent to the sisters\\' home around 10 a. m. to conduct what he called a wellness check after they did not show up at work. The door to the home was open, he said, and the officer found the bodies inside. The Rev. Greg Plata, the priest at St. Thomas the Apostle Church in Lexington, where the nuns were active, said he had been told by the police that they were stabbed. One of their cars, a blue Toyota Corolla, was missing. Warren Strain, a spokesman for the Mississippi Department of Public Safety, said the car was found abandoned Thursday evening on a secluded street barely a mile from the home, The Associated Press reported. Father Plata said the two women were the only ones who lived in the house. It was not clear if the killings were related to their work. He said they dressed in civilian attire, or scrubs when they were at work. Chief Lee said that he could not speculate about a motive and that a cause of death had yet to be officially determined. The Police Department was being helped by the State Bureau of Investigation and the Holmes County Sheriff\\'s Department. \"An actual double homicide is an enigma,\" he said, adding that the house was in one of the quietest parts of the city and that the nuns would often jog or walk around the neighborhood. The Mississippi secretary of state, Delbert Hosemann, said in a statement that he hoped justice would be \"swiftly served. \" He said the nuns had been violently killed, adding, \"Unbridled love and care for mankind has been met with unparalleled savagery. \" Jamie Sample, 58, of Ebenezer, Miss. the music minister at St. Thomas the Apostle Church, said she had relied on the nuns for their \"gorgeous voices\" at Mass. \"I just cannot tell you what precious people they were,\" she said. \"They were just the sweetest people to ever draw a breath into their bodies. \" She described the nuns as being like family. They spent time together at the holidays, and Ms. Sample\\'s husband and son took care of their home repairs. Ms. Sample added that whoever had killed the nuns was \"the epitome of evil. \" She said Sister Margaret was an outstanding chef who regularly took delicious dishes to the church\\'s potluck events. Sister Paula\\'s nephew, David V. Merrill, 37, of Stoneham, Mass. recalled his aunt battling squirrels to grow blueberries in the backyard of their ranch house. He said she enjoyed ministering to the needy of Holmes County, where 44 percent of the residents live below the poverty level â€” the rate among the state\\'s 82 counties, according to census data. \"The work, it was her calling from God,\" Mr. Merrill said. \"She lived and loved it every day. \" Mr. Merrill said his aunt had never expressed concern about her safety. He said the biggest misgiving in the community was about the abuse of opioids. Sister Paula was a native of Massachusetts who developed a Southern drawl but retained a New Englander\\'s cynicism, he said. Maureen Smith, the communications director of the Catholic Diocese of Jackson, Miss. said Sister Paula was from the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth, based in Kentucky, and Sister Margaret was from the School Sisters of St. Francis, in Milwaukee. The United States Province Leadership team for the School Sisters said in a statement that its members were \"deeply shocked and grieved\" by the killings. It noted that Sister Margaret had been with the order for 49 years and devoted herself to \"living her ministry caring for and healing the poor. \" The two nuns had been sent by their orders to serve the poor throughout Mississippi. Sister Paula had spent 30 years in the state, the last six at the clinic, which saw 8, 000 patients last year. Four in 10 people in the county are uninsured or have only Medicaid, Ms. Smith said. The nuns were active in the church\\'s Bible study, Father Plata said, and were deeply connected to the congregation of about 30 parishioners. \"People were attracted to them because of their goodness,\" said Father Plata, who will be among the clergy members to say their funeral Mass.',\n",

(I\\'m not sending this e-mail to make you angry or upset you just to get a better understanding.) Let me get my questions: 1.) I hear much about \"our\" White race \"dying\" or disappearing is this true? If so what stats do you have suggesting this? 2.) Why do you wear the Brown shirts of the SA when Hitler disbanned the SA? Why not black the color of the SS? 3.) I myself have many sympathies for Adolf Hitler I understand he is your \"official leader\" but why do you respect him after saying such things as - \"How fortunate for leaders that men do not think.\" Does this quote not sound like he is in essence trying to \"slide something under the rug\" by saying that if you lie to the people you can get away with pretty much anything? If i\\'m wrong I would appreciate it if you would correct me. : ) 4.) What do you think about the black race? Do you view that the White race is superior to them? If so why? Do you believe that they should live in the U.S.? 5.) If we are indeed superior to every other race, what kinds of things make \"us\" (The White Race) superior? 6.) I also see the word \"Nature\" used with a capital \"N\" what is this \"Nature?\" 7.) I already know your stance on interacial marriage but, why is it that it is bad? (Do not dogs interbreed and you get different breeds.) What is different about this and the human race? 8.) Is our race truly in that much danger that we should not \"interbreed?\" What is it about this that is so important? 9.)

              " 'Using the long-debunked Planned Parenthood videos that were heavily edited to show the sale of fetal tissue, House Republicans have decided that if they can t punish PP, they would terrorize researchers instead:WASHINGTON A special House committee empaneled to investigate fetal tissue research is preparing to issue 17 subpoenas to medical supply companies and laboratories, seeking the names of researchers, graduate students, laboratory technicians and administrative personnel.The House investigation into how some of the nation s most prestigious universities acquire fetal tissue has prompted charges of intimidation and coercion, escalating a battle that some researchers fear could shut down studies seeking cures for Parkinson s disease, the Zika virus and a host of other conditions.Republicans know full well that the donation of aborted fetal tissue is perfectly legal and vitally necessary to life-saving research. But this is an election year, so they re willfully putting that same life-saving research in jeopardy just to feed red meat to their idiot base.If you listen carefully, you can already hear the so-called pro-life movement flexing their fingers, ready to start typing death threats to any researchers that have their names revealed. But don t call them domestic terrorists! They re just using fear and violence to get their way.Keep in mind, these researchers are literally saving millions of lives by curing diseases and discovering ways to fix traumatic damage to the human body. But once their names are forced into the public square, they will be called murderers and monsters by people who think the height of morality is screaming at teenage girls trying to get rid of their rapist s fetus.Even worse, if Republicans get their way, it s only a matter of time until some crazed, but somehow still responsible, gun owner goes on a rampage and shoots up a research facility to save the murdered babies or some such stupidity. Or maybe someone will just set the lab on fire. Or try to blow it up. The fact that they could be killing the person that cures cancer or destroying the research that could have ended birth defects won t even occur to them.This kind of short-term irresponsibility is all Republicans know how to do anymore. Exposing these people s names to the violent pro-life movement is a recipe for disaster but a surefire way to get votes. But it s not like they ll ever accept responsibility for the consequences, anyway.',\n",

              " 'Austria s new conservative-far right ruling coalition is likely to be sworn in on Dec. 20, an informed source said on Friday, marking a victory for nationalists so far shut out of government elsewhere in western Europe. Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz, whose mainstream conservative People s Party (OVP) won a parliamentary election on Oct. 15 but not a majority, has been in coalition talks with Heinz-Christian Strache s Freedom Party (FPO). Both sides have described the discussions as friendly and constructive but so far failed to disclose the kind of sweeping tax, immigration and administrative reforms they had called for in their campaigns. Kurz, 31, who has taken a tough stance on immigration and Muslim parallel societies , tilting towards the FPO line as the far right surged in popularity, is tipped to become chancellor and the youngest head of government in the European Union. There has been no confirmation on who might get which portfolio in the new cabinet, but the anti-immigration FPO has said it would aim for about half of the ministries. The OVP gained 31.5 percent and the FPO 26 percent of votes in the Alpine republic s October election. (Dec. 20) is certainly a possible date (for the swearing-in), OVP Chairwoman Elisabeth Koestinger said on Oe1 radio, adding they would put quality before speed even if that meant a deal only after Christmas. FPO deputy leader Norbert Hofer told Oe1 that no deal had been sealed yet, repeating previous statements that both parties aimed to finish before Christmas. The Austrian national news agency APA also cited Dec. 20 as the most likely date for the swearing-in of the new government by President Alexander Van der Bellen, but listed Jan. 8 as an alternative date. The FPO, which came within a whisker of winning the 2015 presidential election, is allied with France s National Front and Germany s AfD, which in a September election became the third strongest party in Germany s parliament. The populist far right last entered an Austrian federal government in 2000 and currently rules in coalition with centrists in two of the country s provinces.',\n",

As I now know the decision was made to investigate it at HQ with a small team, McCabe wrote in the email. He said he had no input when the Clinton email investigation started in summer 2015, while he was serving as assistant director in charge of the FBI s Washington office. [The Washington office] provided some personnel for the effort but it was referred to as a special and I was not given any details about it, he wrote.FBI officials on Wednesday night refused to answer what McCabe meant by calling the Clinton email probe a special or why it was restricted to a small team at headquarters when it began. We don t have anything to add to the documents that were released, bureau spokeswoman Carol Cratty wrote The Hill.The note was contained in more than 70 pages of emails the FBI released on its public records site known as The Vault.The emails chronicled McCabe s efforts to address a separate controversy involving his wife s 2015 campaign for political office.McCabe s references to a special status for the Clinton probe are likely to be used as ammunition by Republican lawmakers critical of former FBI Director James Comey s handling of the Clinton investigation.Remember that the DOJ s Loretta Lynch also wanted Clinton s case to be called an incident and not an investigation. It looks like all intel agencies were doing all they could to protect Clinton. Was it to save themselves from exposure in the Uranium One case or something else?',\n",

Date: Tue, 3 Sep 2002 22:49:20 -0600 Bob, This capacitor drive idea isn\\'t completely stupid, but neither is it well thought out. Maxwell (www.maxwell.com) makes and sells high energy density capacitors, called ultracapacitors. They deliver them in an air-cooled, voltage regulated module that will charge to 42 V and hold 128 kilojoules -- roughly the energy in 2 teaspoons of sugar or a bite of a donut -- and weighs 16 kilograms. If that electrical energy could all be converted to kinetic energy, there\\'s enough to get the capacitor module up to about 200 mph -- in a vacuum. Suppose you take the entire power density of the capacitor module -- 2.8 kw/kg (~4 hp/kg!) -- and punch it through an electric motor. How much does the 64 hp electric motor weigh? If it were as little as 50 kg -- and I bet it isn\\'t -- that capacitor and motor would have a top speed of 100 mph -- the speed at which their energy is the 128 kJ that was initially stored electrically in the capacitor. And it\\'s not at all obvious that the torque vs. speed characteristic of 42 V DC motors will support this, or how they do it without wheels, drive train, etc. But if they can, they can only do it in a vacuum where there is no drag! On to the Lunarnationals? Or would you prefer the bite of donut? ----- Original Message ----- From: \"R. A.

              " 'President Donald Trump has made his selection for the next full-time head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Testifying before lawmakers on Thursday, Mnuchin did not name the person tapped for the job, but said the decision had been made and the individual is going through background checks before a formal announcement. The comptroller position is currently being filled in an acting capacity by Keith Noreika, an attorney whom Mnuchin named as interim head earlier in May. Noreika replaced Thomas Curry, who had served as comptroller under President Obama. \"We actually have someone the president has approved that is going through the FBI vetting process,\" Mnuchin said. \"This is a time-consuming process.\" Joseph Otting, who formerly worked as a banking executive at OneWest bank, which Mnuchin once headed, is believed to be the favorite for the position. Mnuchin said that an OCC pick had been made in response to criticism from Democrats, who objected to Trump installing a new bank regulator on an interim basis who was not confirmed by the Senate. Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland questioned whether this approach was to skirt Senate approval. But Mnuchin insisted Noreika was put in place simply to get someone in the post while a permanent nominee was selected. The Comptroller\\'s office writes money-laundering rules, bank charters and closely monitors banks\\' lending activities.',\n",

              " 'The presidential campaigns of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich announced late Sunday that they were coordinating their efforts in three upcoming primary states in an extraordinary attempt to prevent Republican front-runner Donald Trump from clinching the GOP nomination before this summer\\'s convention. In a pair of simultaneously released statements, the campaigns announced that Kasich would pull out of Indiana to give Cruz \"a clear path\" ahead of that state\\'s winner-take-all primary May 3, while the Cruz campaign will \"clear the path\" for Kasich in Oregon, which votes May 17, and New Mexico, which votes June 7. \"Having Donald Trump at the top of the ticket in November would be a sure disaster for Republicans,\" Cruz\\'s campaign manager, Jeff Roe, said. \"To ensure that we nominate a Republican who can unify the Republican Party and win in November, our campaign will focus its time and resources in Indiana and in turn clear the path for Gov. Kasich to compete in Oregon and New Mexico, and we would hope that allies of both campaigns would follow our lead.\" The arrangement marks a sharp reversal for Cruz\\'s team, which aggressively opposed the idea of a coordinated anti-Trump effort as recently as late last week. Yet it underscores a bleak reality for the billionaire businessman\\'s Republican foes: Time is running out to stop him. A statement from the Trump campaign called the move \"a horrible act of desperation from two campaigns who have horribly failed.\" The Kasich campaign confirmed to Fox News that it had canceled two Indiana campaign events scheduled for Tuesday. As recently as three days ago Kasich\\'s campaign announced investments in Indiana, including the opening of two offices and the creation of a campaign leadership team. Campaign manager John Weaver said in his statement that the Kasich team hoped to perform well in Oregon and New Mexico, which Weaver said were \"structurally similar\" to northeastern states where Kasich performed well earlier in the cycle. \"Our goal is to have an open convention in Cleveland,\" Weaver added, \"where we are confident a candidate capable of uniting the party and winning in November will emerge as the nominee.\" The announcement came less than 48 hours before voting begins across five Northeastern states where the New York billionaire is poised to add to his already overwhelming delegate lead. Trump campaigned Sunday in Maryland, which will vote on Tuesday along with Rhode Island, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Delaware. Trump needs 1,237 delegates to win the Republican nomination. If he falls short, the national Republican gathering in July will evolve into a rare contested convention. At a rally in Hagerstown, Md., Trump stressed repeatedly that he expects to win the 1,237 delegates needed in the first round of voting to stave off a contested convention. \"I only care about the first. We\\'re not going for the second and third and fourth and fifth,\" said Trump. Even before the plan was announced, Cruz had all but abandoned the Northeastern states in favor of Indiana, which holds its primary on May 3. Both Cruz and Kasich had cast the state as a critical turning point. \"Keeping Trump from winning a plurality in Indiana is critical to keeping him under 1,237 bound delegates before Cleveland,\" Kasich\\'s campaign said Sunday. \"We are very comfortable with our delegate position in Indiana already, and given the current dynamics of the primary there, we will shift our campaign\\'s resources west and give the Cruz campaign a clear path in Indiana.\" Indiana will award 57 delegates to the winner of its primary. Oregon and New Mexico have 28 and 24 proportionately awarded delegates at stake, respectively. Fox News\\' Dan Gallo and the Associated Press contributed to this report.',\n",

VIDEO \"I do think it is important for us to understand the nature of the threat; what works and what doesn\\'t. Painting the Muslim community with a broad brush does not work. They are the greatest allies in fighting against the organizations...Most importantly, we have to stay true to our values during the process. We have to make sure that we are not engaging in the kind of the knee-jerk anti-Muslim sentiment that we have heard from some politicians. We have to make sure that the legal structures around our intelligence gathering and our use of predators are subject to oversight. It is not always going to be easy. It is not always going to be perfectly smooth. There are going to be times where as president you make a decision knowing that there are going to be critics, and knowing that there\\'s some gray areas, and ambiguities that you have to deal with given the realities of the situation, but overall, I think that we can draw a lesson from the Bin Laden raid that we have got really effective people and a government that knows how to do this. As long as we operate from the position of confidence and strength and are true to who we are, groups like this or the individuals like this cannot defeat us.\" President Obama is correct. Success in combating terror requires strong relationships with our Muslim allies in the Middle East and Muslims in the United States who are often the first line of defense against terror attacks. In fact, taking out Osama Bin Laden depended on those relationships with Muslims in Afghanistan and Pakistan who provided intelligence to U.S. officials. The President\\'s comments put Dangerous Donald Trump\\'s lack of judgment in context, including his absurd proposal to ban an entire religion from the United States, along with his and other half-baked proposals and foreign policy cluelessness, has that have alarmed our allies throughout the world - including leaders in the Middle East who are our partners in fighting terror. They\\'re also a reminder that Ted Cruz has been just as disconnected from reality in his calls has called for \"carpet bombing\" the Middle East Syria and Iraq with no regard to civilian lives, and would force law enforcement to \"patrol and secure\" neighborhoods where Muslim-Americans live, a dangerous and discriminatory policy that resembles the political witch hunts of the McCarthy era would only make our communities less safe.

              "['And one more from Variety (this article was the main feature in their latest edition) Amy Dacey, CEO of the Democratic National Committee, says, \"You have to go to where people are getting their information, and where people are watching. Some times I think candidates go to places where they think they can get their message across in a fast way, but they also diversify. They are talking to print reporters. They are talking on cable news. They are talking on social media. And they are having some appearances on some of these shows. But the bottom line is to get more people engaged and realizing about the election and what is at stake, so I think you have to factor in all of those things.\" Presidential Race Takes Over Pop Culture as Hopefuls Embrace Celebrity Status [Senior Editor] Ted Johnson Senior Editor Bernie Sanders looked exhausted as he got off a flight from Las Vegas in October at Burbank Bob Hope Airport and walked through the concourse, to be met by a reporter with a question. The query concerned the record ratings for the first Democratic debate, and Sanders gave a serious, on-message answer that tied the Nielsens to his campaign\\'s core message, saying the numbers proved that viewers are interested in \"the real crises facing the American middle class.\" An hour later, Sanders was decidedly more lighthearted, dancing on a Warner Bros. soundstage during an appearance on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show,\" where he answered questions about his hair, whether he\\'d ever been in handcuffs and his favorite member of One Direction. [ ANITA KUNZ FOR VARIETY It\\'s nothing new for candidates to gamely turn to showbiz outlets to reach the electorate. But in this crazy election cycle, what is new is the magnitude of such activity. Never has politics been so blended with entertainment. Contentious presidential debates help drive larger audiences than most new fall series; candidates are eager to take part in sketches on late-night TV and strive to be hip to pop-culture references, to sprinkle catch-phrases into their tweets and to reveal their music playlists; and celebrity surrogates are as polarizing as the candidates themselves. It\\'s a climate in which celebrity status seems to translate into political clout, and in which level of exposure is scrutinized as much as polling numbers. A carnival atmosphere has always surrounded presidential campaigns, but the mix of pop with politics has become serious business that translates to awareness, attention and adulation. MediaQuant, an analytics firm, drew headlines last month when it calculated Donald Trump \\'s \"earned media\" output â€” a dollar amount tied to the free exposure he has gotten from countless interviews, magazine covers, talk-show skits and morning-show call-in interviews. The tally was $2.4 billion â€” more than the combined total for Hillary Clinton ($947 million), Ted Cruz ($532 million) and Sanders ($480 million). By another measurement â€” exposure across hundreds of consumer publications â€” Trump and Clinton beat sports stars like Tom Brady and celebrities like Kanye West, Kim Kardashian and Justin Bieber when it comes to the value of their \"earned\" media, according to MediaQuant. \"One of the things I have gotten marginally famous for years ago was saying, \\'Politics is show business for ugly people,\\' \" says political consultant Paul Begala, chief strategist for the 1992 Clinton-Gore ticket. \"And so much more today than ever,\" he adds. \"It is becoming both more showbiz-y and more ugly.\" Take Hillary Clinton, whose cameo on \"Saturday Night Live\" drew enough of a stir that the candidate has embraced other scripted shows, including making a highly publicized appearance on Comedy Central sitcom \"Broad City.\" Her campaign has countered the news-media drumbeat of \"those damn emails\" and Goldman Sachs speeches with exposure that is humorous and self-deprecating. In March, the Clinton campaign unveiled an unusual 30-second spot on ABC that featured the stars of Shonda Rhimes\\' shows â€” and that ran the night those series aired. The network was apparently concerned enough over potential viewer confusion that it released a statement noting that \"broadcasters are required by the FCC to carry these ads.\" Cruz, whose image was heavily defined by D.C. media as the man who once helped shut down the government, made a habit of sprinkling into his speeches references to \"Star Wars,\" along with TV-born catchphrases like \"jump the shark\" and a reenactment of the \"mostly dead\" scene from \"The Princess Bride.\" Just a few months into his campaign, he appeared in a Buzzfeed video in which he did an array of impressions from \"The Simpsons.\" [ Bernie Sanders visits with \"Ellen\"; Hillary Clinton cozies up to\"Broad City\\'s\" Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson; Ted Cruz channels \"Simpsons\" characters for Buzzfeed. COURTESY OF COMEDY CENTRAL/NBC/BUZZFEED When Sanders first entered the race, he seemed so laser-focused on his core message that he couldn\\'t be bothered with offbeat questions on lifestyle topics. Last August, he scolded a New York Times writer who asked him about the scrutiny of Hillary Clinton\\'s hair vs. his. But by the time he did Ellen\\'s show, he was game to laugh. Then there\\'s Donald Trump, who entered the campaign (down an escalator) already an entertainment celebrity via \"The Apprentice,\" but one with a rather high negative \\'Q\\' score. He countered with shtick â€” a break-all-the-rules strategy in which all publicity is good publicity. In the first Republican debate, when Megyn Kelly asked him about his treatment of women, his first instinct wasn\\'t to attack the question or Kelly (although he eventually did) but to get in a nasty one-liner about Rosie O\\'Donnell. Mark McKinnon, political consultant and co-creator of Showtime\\'s \"The Circus,\" which documents the ongoing campaign, says Americans are looking to be entertained as well as informed. \"So to break through the clutter,\" he says, \"the candidates are compelled to look to nontraditional venues and formats to communicate their message. \"One thing we\\'ve learned doing \\'The Circus\\' is that voters are hungry for authenticity,\" he adds. \"They want to see what the candidates are like beyond the talking points, debates and speeches. So, alternative approaches give them an opportunity to show a side of themselves that voters rarely see but want to see. It gives voters more context and nuance for what kind of person the candidate is.\" Kristina Schake, deputy communications director for the Clinton campaign, says appearances on entertainment shows are great avenues to reach people, and have allowed the candidate to share information younger voters may not know about, such as her time at Wellesley College or with the Children\\'s Defense Fund, before she was Secretary of State. Bits on \"Saturday Night Live\" and other shows, she says, \"have been invaluable.\" \"The skit of Hillary playing Val the bartender [on \"SNL\"] and Kate McKinnon playing Hillary was one of the most talked about television appearances in terms of reach this cycle,\" Schake says. \"These moments matter because they transcend party affiliation, and everyone can enjoy them. The Secretary has enjoyed them too, and still can\\'t believe they convinced her to sing in it.\" \"One of the things I have gotten marginally famous for years ago was saying, \\'Politics is show business for ugly people.\\' And so much more today than ever. It is becoming both more showbiz-y and more ugly.\" PAUL BEGALA, POLITICAL STRATEGIST The rise in such appearances also is a function of a fragmented media universe. Amy Dacey, CEO of the Democratic National Committee, says, \"You have to go to where people are getting their information, and where people are watching. Some times I think candidates go to places where they think they can get their message across in a fast way, but they also diversify. They are talking to print reporters. They are talking on cable news. They are talking on social media. And they are having some appearances on some of these shows. But the bottom line is to get more people engaged and realizing about the election and what is at stake, so I think you have to factor in all of those things.\" Television has long been seen as an outlet to connect with voters â€” but some candidates have expressed reluctance. Almost 50 years ago, as Richard Nixon\\'s handlers carefully crafted a comeback, they convinced him to do a guest spot on \"The Mike Douglas Show,\" the soft, celebrity-driven talk show based in Philadelphia. \"You know, politics is more and more becoming show business,\" Nixon said, as he bantered over such topics as his tan with Douglas and that week\\'s co-hosts, Sandler and Young. Off camera, Nixon reportedly said, \"It\\'s a shame a man has to use gimmicks like this to get elected.\" Nine months later, having secured the Republican nomination amid the tumult of 1968, Nixon tapped pop culture again. He did the hottest show on TV, \"Laugh-In,\" in a clip that lasted just a few seconds but showed he was hip to what was hip. \"Sock it to me?\" he said, repeating the show\\'s catchphrase. \"Laugh-In\" creator George Schlatter notes that the show tried, but failed, to get rival Hubert Humphrey to appear. In the years since, candidates have tapped pop culture to varying degrees: President Gerald Ford made a pre-filmed cameo on \"Saturday Night Live\" in the midst of the 1976 primary campaign; Ronald Reagan, the first actor to become president, used a signature line from one of his movies â€” \"Go win one for the Gipper\" â€” as a call to action for his campaign; and Bill Clinton played the saxophone on \"The Arsenio Hall Show\" during the 1992 race. \"When we put Bill Clinton on \\'Arsenio Hall,\\' it was scandalous,\" Begala recalls. \"We got a ton of static. And now it is mandatory.\" Perhaps no candidate or president has been more savvy in trying to command attention through entertainment than President Obama. He was the first sitting commander-in-chief to make an in-studio appearance on a late-night talk show, when he sat down with Jay Leno on \"The Tonight Show\" less than two months after taking office. In 2013, his appearance with Zach Galifianakis on Funny or Die\\'s \"Between Two Ferns\" was credited with helping drive enrollment in Obama Care. By the time he appeared in Jerry Seinfield\\'s \"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee\" last year, any talk of whether Obama\\'s cameos are \"presidential\" had given way to discussion of whether they are laugh-out-loud funny. By the time of this year\\'s campaign, it wasn\\'t a question of whether a candidate would do late-night TV; it was how far they would go to make a mark. [ Donald Trump has been so ubiquitous in the media this campaign season, sometimes it seems like there must be more than one of him. Taran Killam and Darrell Hammond help fuel that conceit on a skit from the Trump-hosted Nov. 7 airing of \"Saturday Night Live.\" COURTESY OF NBC While late-night interviews with candidates have made news, comedic skits have made lasting impressions, like the one in which Clinton took a phone call from Trump (aka Fallon) on \"The Tonight Show,\" or when Mitt Romney read mean tweets from Trump on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live,\" or, most prominently, when Trump himself hosted \"Saturday Night Live.\" Jon Macks, a writer on Leno\\'s \"Tonight Show\" throughout its run who specializes in political humor, says that with candidates popping up all over late night, mere appearances no longer pack the punch they once did. \"It is what it is,\" he says. \"You are not going to see JFK, when he was a senator, on Jack Paar for an hour. Or John Kerry on Jay Leno having a legitimate and smart conversation about policies. You see it once in a while, but not to the degree you have seen it in the past.\" Part of the reason is the drive for skits that will travel virally â€” not necessarily a desire to succinctly convey a policy position. \"In a world defined by six-second Vines, the eight-second sound bite seems like the Gettysburg Address,\" Macks says. \"The candidates are entertainment in and of themselves,\" he adds. \"When candidates go on \\'Jimmy Fallon,\\' they are not going on to position themselves with the electorate. They are going on to be part of a skit. They are not doing a bit to lead to some big policy discussion. It is entertainment as pure entertainment.\" For the few candidates who balk, the alternative is to be out-entertained. Dave Berg, co-producer of Leno\\'s \"Tonight Show,\" was a supporter of Marco Rubio and urged the campaign to maximize opportunities on late night. Instead, he said, the campaign squandered its chances: Rubio\\'s appearance on \"The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon\" in January, for instance, turned out to be unmemorable. Berg calls the interview \"substandard,\" and wonders why the Rubio campaign didn\\'t try to tap further into pop culture, given the candidate\\'s telegenic personality and youth. When candidates do try comedy, the right choices are \"very, very important,\" Berg says, even though such appearances are typically short on policy details. \"It is important that you get the right sketch. If it is the wrong sketch, it can be disastrous.\" When Kerry appeared on \"Leno\" during the 2004 campaign, he insisted on riding in on a motorcycle. The result, says Berg, \"reminded me of Dukakis riding in the tank with a helmet on.\" Candidates almost always have veto power over a sketch. \"Some of our writers would write 10 bits that would be rejected by the candidates,\" Berg recalls. \"Our writers couldn\\'t stand Al Gore. His people would reject bit after bit, even though they were going to vote for him.\" Still, rarely were candidates unwilling to do any routine at all, he says. \"One thing I have learned about people in the political world, and also about commentators and journalists: In each and every one of these people is a comedian dying to get out.\" Actor Mark Ruffalo, an activist-actor who is backing Sanders, believes authenticity is the key to successfully connecting with voters via entertainment platforms. He notes that his son\\'s favorite shows are on YouTube, featuring user-generated celebrities, because \"it has a credibility to it. There is no artifice. \"When candidates go on \\'Jimmy Fallon,\\' they are not going on to position themselves with the electorate. They are going on to be part of a skit. It is entertainment as pure entertainment.\" JON MACKS, WRITER \"It is reaching people in ways that the mainstream media can\\'t, for one,\" he adds. \"It is a direct line to your constituency. There is no middle man.\" Such a targeted connection is important, he says, because of the way people consume media. \"We live in this era of decentralization,\" he explains. \"The entertainment industry is decentralizing. The news is decentralizing. What you are seeing is politicians finally realizing it is a way of reaching people that feels less artificial.\" Earlier this month, Clinton ended Trump\\'s dominance of one audience metric when she surpassed him in weekly YouTube views, according to video identification tech firm Zefr. A reason: The clip of her struggle to use a New York subway card was a big draw, with more than 1 million views. Begala points out that as much as we\\'ve seen the fusion of campaigns and entertainment, what we have yet to witness this cycle is a breakthrough viral hit on the order of Will.i.am\\'s 2008 \"Yes, We Can\" video, which featured Obama\\'s New Hampshire primary speech and went on to post more than 20 million hits on YouTube. \"That was groundbreaking,\" Begala says. \"I think you will get that, but it has to be organic. It can\\'t be forced by some political consultant like me.\" There has been unique user-generated content. Cruz\\'s obsession with \"Star Wars\" inspired a video â€” \"The Constitution Strikes Back,\" with Cruz as a Jedi warrior â€” created by producer Joel Gilbert. Gilbert made the video independently of the campaign â€” although Cruz\\'s team did tweet it out after it was posted. Gilbert says he saw a need for something that could do more to market Cruz\\'s image and background, particularly to younger voters, given that the candidate is 45 and now the youngest in the race. \"Generally these Republican strategists, who have been running campaigns for years, don\\'t have much of an affinity of how powerful pop culture can be,\" Gilbert says. As much as showbiz is intrinsic to politics, the downside is when theatrics overshadow serious thinking. One of the more telling quotes from the current candidates came from Trump, who discussed his media ubiquity with Time in March. \"I go on one of these shows, and the ratings double,\" he said. \"They triple. And that gives you power. It\\'s not the polls. It\\'s the ratings.\" RELATED [1952: On Sept. 23, vice presidential candidate Richard Nixon responds to accusations of financial improprieties on national TV, vowing to keep his dog Checkers no matter what, and garnering the largest television audience at that time.] Politics and Pop Culture: Top Moments in History Star Jones, former co-host of \"The View,\" who has been a surrogate for Clinton, says that the vitriol of this campaign is a contrast to previous cycles. \"It is almost as if we have gone to the reality-show world of politics.\" That is especially true when it comes to celebrities entering the political area â€” and 2016 is destined to define the limits of that success. Fred Grandy, who ran for Congress and won in 1986, two years after starring in \"The Love Boat,\" says that Trump is running up against the public\\'s desire for the next act. The billionaire spent the time after his wins on Super Tuesday and his loss in Wisconsin going from one reality-show-like flap to another. \"He has not been able to take the enormous advantage that celebrity confers upon you, and deepen that into a kind of gravitas and wisdom that gives people a certain comfort level,\" Grandy says. Trump\\'s recent win in New York helped him rebound, but he still faces high unfavorable polling numbers. The candidate, Grandy adds, has seized on two key issues, immigration and trade, and has capitalized on his ability to stage a show. \"Donald Trump has a speaking cadence that is somewhat between standup and rap, but people like that. It is talking to somebody and not down to somebody.\" Still, at a certain point voters will want assurance that candidates will be presidential. \"Trump has had popularity,\" Grandy says. \"It doesn\\'t mean it is a love affair. It\\'s an infatuation.\" From: Garcia, Walter Sent: Friday, April 15, 2016 2:33 PM To: Wei, Shu-Yen Cc: Manriquez, Pablo; Comm_D Subject: RE: Dacey Courts AAPI Voters in Los Angeles A little late, but here\\'s one more article: DNC REACHING OUT TO ASIAN AMERICAN VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA By Steve Angeles, Balitang America The 2016 presidential election is seven months away. Issues continue, the race for the Democratic presidential nomination is getting more heated than expected, and Asian American voters are being courted. One of those reaching out is Amy Dacey. The CEO of the Democratic National Committee recently visited Californiaâ€“the state with the most Asian Americansâ€“holding a round table with the media and meeting with local communities. Dacey said they saw a record turnout from Asian Americans in support of President Obama in 2012. She also said 4.5 million Asian Americans are now 18 and were able to register to vote in 2012. \"I do think they can have a strong voice in this election, and I do think what you\\'re seeing are issues that they do care about,\" said Dacey. \"That\\'s why we\\'re doing a lot of outreach right now, myself, we are doing this swing through.\" Dacey said the DNC is continuing to reach out to Asian Americans and the Asian Pacific Islander community through various groups and community organizations. They also correspond with weekly papers, radio stations and social media to spread information. When it comes to the election cycles, primaries and nominations are often wrapped up before California\\'s June primaries but this time, with Bernie Sanders gaining some momentum against Hillary Clinton, there is a possibility that the Golden State can play a role in the Democratic race. \"Both candidates were recently here,\" she said. \"Whether it was a big rally, talked to individuals and had a very serious speech that secretary Clinton gave about the importance of what\\'s happening in our foreign policy, I think that clearly shows they\\'re invested in California.\" Leaders from both parties have come out to Los Angeles to do their own outreach. Jason Chung, national director of the Asian Pacific American Initiatives for the Republican National Committee also came to California for outreach efforts. He joined Dacey at the Asian American justice conference, where they were part of a panel that unveiled new polling data on California\\'s Asian American voters. Data showed that no matter the partyâ€“Democrat, Republican, or Independentâ€“the state\\'s Asian American voters have similar priorities. Immigration, education and health care are issues that are expected to bring them to the ballot boxes.

DNC Chief Executive Officer Amy Dacey told reporters yesterday (Wednesday in Manila) they have expanded their grassroots outreach to members of the nation\\'s fastest-growing ethnic group. \"We\\'re looking at how we\\'re communicating with themâ€¦and how they\\'re getting their information about the party, what we stand for, the general election and our candidates,\" Dacey said in a roundtable discussion with the media in downtown Los Angeles. \"We\\'re working on the local level everyday to do that. Peer-to-peer conversation, people hearing from members of their community matters a lot.\" Studies show AAPIs will soon outnumber Latinos as the largest immigrant group coming to the United States. While AAPIs are concentrated in California and New York, they are also rapidly growing in the battleground states of Nevada, Virginia, and Florida. That means capturing the Asian American vote is important in the November elections, according to the Asian American Advancing Justice, which is set to release new polling data on AAPIs today (Thursday in Manila). In the last few presidential elections, Fil-Ams and other AAPIs had leaned heavily democrat, and the DNC hopes to get more of them to vote. \"The issues that (Democrats) are focusing on are very tuned in to the Filipino-American community, especially the issues ofimmigration and health care,\" said Fil-Am Fritz Friedman, former Sony Pictures senior vice president of worldwide publicity who serves on the credentials committee for DNC\\'s national convention this July in Philadelphia. \"Also, the Democratic Party is much more inclusive. They understand people of color, as opposed to Republicans (who), in my opinion, are not as sensitive to the interests of the ethnic minorities in this country.\" Dacey said she\\'s confident the party will have a presidential nominee before the national convention and that nominee will win the race for the White House. \"I am confident that one of our candidates will be the 45th president of the United States,\" said Dacey, who is scheduled to meet with party leaders in California. She declined to say who she thought would be the presidential nominee. \"Both (Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders) have run campaigns that are worthy of the office of the president,\" she said.

              " 'A New Paradigm for Diagnosis and Treatment of Modern Chronic Illnesses Dr. Judy Mikovits  by John P. Thomas Health Impact News  The persistent investigation of Dr. Mikovits into the cause and treatment of modern illnesses, along with a handful of other scientists and healthcare providers such as the late Dr. Jeff Bradstreet, M.D., is leading us toward a new understanding of modern illness and its treatment.  Dr. Mikovits sees the bigger picture of health and illness that few scientists and healthcare providers have the courage to examine. She had great respect for the work of Dr. Bradstreet and his successful use of the new paradigm for treating difficult illnesses. Dr. Mikovits stated:  Dr. Bradstreet recognized that what we call autism is in fact an acquired immune deficiency. What we know of as autism is part of a collection of more than 60 diseases that is spiraling and increasing in our environment.  It is acquired immune deficiency resulting from all the toxins, all the vaccines and other contaminants in our environment from these biologicals that in fact means that what we know of as autism spectrum disorder is an acquired immune deficiency. [1] A Family of Acquired Immune Deficiency Diseases  Many who read this may be initially confused or may even balk at the use of the term Acquired Immune Deficiency , because of the association with HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS is one of many acquired immune deficiency syndromes (diseases). It is an acquired immune deficiency caused by the virus that is commonly called HIV. However, HIV is not the only acquired immune deficiency disease â€“ there are more than 60 others, which can result in non-HIV AIDS.  When the human immune system is repeatedly stressed and weakened by toxic food, by toxins in the environment, and by toxic vaccines, then chronic retrovirus related illnesses can begin to emerge from their slumber. We can give a general name to all these illnesses. We can simply call them Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes or non-HIV AIDS.  The conventional healthcare system struggles to accurately diagnose these modern diseases, because there are so many overlapping sets of symptoms. Beyond the specific symptoms is the same underlying problem, which is immune system dysregulation and dysfunction.  People with these diseases have immune systems that have been pushed to the max by various stressors. Their immune systems have been pushed to the point of breakage where retroviral infections can be released from their confinement and begin to reproduce in the body.  Once this happens, the immune system is no longer able to adequately respond to the insults that it was formerly able to control. Various immune system pathways keep trying to fix the situation, but can\\'t overcome the damage.  An acquired immune deficiency is simply an immune system that has been broken to such a degree that it cannot properly respond to the conditions that are causing illness. It is so broken that it cannot even repair itself. The result of such severe immune dysfunction is chronic disabling illness. The Central Tenet of Modern Chronic Illnesses  Dr. Mikovits explains more about the new understanding of the immune system and the paradigm shift that is leading healthcare providers to reconsider long-held assumptions about health and illness. It is causing them to rethink what it means to bring about a \"cure\" for modern illnesses. Dr. Mikovits stated:  The paradigm shift was recognizing that the macrophage was the central tenet of disease. Our central hypothesis, which we have held for more than three decades, is that there is a critical threshold of immune activation, and when the activation rises above that level, damage to the immune system is being created. Damage is created at a distance.  The damage may be subclinical and it will create imbalance not only in the macrophages, but also in other parts of the immune system. What we want to do is to stop this process.  We want to stop the disease engine, stop the microbial switch from turning on the oxidative stress, and turning on the inflammatory cytokines â€” and doing this over and over again. If we can limit the damage to the subsets of the immune system, then it is possible to modulate and rebalance the immune system and cure the disease. [2] The Power of the Immune System can Heal Modern Diseases  The new paradigm offers the possibility of true cure, because it relies on the power of the human immune system to bring about a cure. Cure is not seen as the eradication of pathogens by pharmaceutical drugs or other means, rather, the goal is to restore the immune system so that it can once again control or manage pathogens.  In the case of retroviral infection such as HIV, HTLV-1 Leukemia virus, and others, these viruses cannot be eradicated from the body once they have imbedded themselves into human DNA. Once retroviruses have inserted themselves into cells, they cannot be removed â€“ they are there for life.  This means that successful treatments will need to prevent further viral reproduction and enable the immune system to control the existing viral load. When this is done, then the symptoms of disease subside and people are able to live normal lives again.  The illnesses we are discussing first appeared after the dawn of the genetic age or they had a sudden increase in prevalence since it began. Many of these diseases were once considered only diseases of the elderly; but today they are appearing in children and even in newborn babies. This is especially true for cancer.  We are seeing babies born with cancer, two-year-olds dying of cancer, children being unable to digest food, teens dropping dead while playing sports, children with severe physical and intellectual delays, young adults in their twenties with disabling neurological failure, people in their 40s and 50s with deteriorating brain function and memory loss, and people of all ages developing brain fog and physical weakness to the point where they can no longer work or even take care of themselves.  Such things were virtually unheard of before the dawning of the genetic Age. The Bad Fruit of the Genetic Age  The diseases listed below are some of the illnesses that are associated with retroviral infection and immune system damage. We cannot say these diseases are caused by retroviruses, but only that retroviruses are often expressed in patients who have these diseases. Aberrant retrovirus expression and a compromised immune system are the common threads that link these diseases together. The prevalence of these diseases has increased dramatically over the past four decades.  Illnesses Associated with Retroviral Infection [3]  Cancers: Prostate, Breast, Lymphoma, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Mantle Cell Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell Leukemia, Hairy Cell Leukemia, Liver, Bladder, Kidney, Pancreas, Colorectal, Ovarian, and Non-Hodgkin\\'s Lymphoma.  Auto-Immune Diseases: Rheumatoid Arthritis, Lupus, Crohn\\'s Disease, Peripheral Neuropathy, Primary Biliary Cirrhosis, Sjogren\\'s Syndrome, Hashimoto\\'s Thyroiditis, Polymyositis, and Bechet\\'s Disease.  Neuro-Immune Diseases: Myalgic Encephalomyelitis or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), Multiple Sclerosis, Fibromyalgia, Gulf-War Syndrome, Morgellons Disease, treatment resistant Lyme disease, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).  Central Nervous System Diseases: Alzheimer\\'s, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, multiple system atrophy, Autism Spectrum Disorders, and Parkinson\\'s.  A central sign of immune system dysfunction in these diseases is extreme fatigue. Many people also note unexplained weight loss or gain. These symptoms are early warning signs of cancer, but also are hallmarks of all the other diseases mentioned above.  In addition, there will be: signs of inflammation, significant hormone dysregulation, highly elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), highly elevated reactive nitrogen species (RNS), changes in gene expression without a change to DNA (epigenetics), actual changes in DNA through the process of insertional mutagenesis in which exogenous genetic material is incorporated within the DNA of a host, and serious immune system deficiency. Proper Treatment of Immune System Dysfunction can Help Patients  This is a grim reality that Dr. Mikovits has been working to change.  The proper treatment of immune system dysfunction can help patients with these types of illnesses. These types of treatments enable the body\\'s normal immune defenses to take up their task and gain control over out-of-control situations in the body. Multiple Factors are Causing Illness and Death in Our Modern Age  These are some of the major factors that work together to damage immune system functioning. Alterations in human DNA caused by the presence of retroviruses, Opportunistic co-infections that accompany retroviral infections, Vaccines and most pharmaceutical drugs, Highly processed food and its toxic ingredients such as GMOs, glyphosate, preservatives, artificial flavorings, hydrogenated oil products, etc., Electromagnetic pollution, Toxic chemical exposure in the environment, Chlorinated and fluoridated drinking water, Biologically inactive and chemically contaminated agricultural soil, Antibiotics and incompatible GMO feed given to animals raised in confined feeding operations, Toxins and artificial fragrances in cleaning products and body care products, Mold infested homes and schools, and Of course, the high sugar and high carbohydrate diet.  These factors, plus many others, which are common to \"modern life\" in America, interact synergistically to damage the immune system. The combined harm is much higher than would be expected by simply adding the potential dangers together. Over time, the stress they produce on the immune system will cause it to crash, and one or more of the illnesses listed above will manifest.  Conventional physicians cannot seem to accept the reality that the modern diseases that plague the world today are linked to multiple factors. They have trouble believing there is synergy between these factors, and that together they could be disrupting the human immune system to the point where disease results. Question for Dr. Mikovits  Is Your Approach Really New?  Basically what I am describing is old-fashioned medicine, and it is rarely done anymore. There are some, of course, who do use these protocols. We need to look at the patient. Talk to the patient. Look at the family. That is what we do. That\\'s what we have always done.  Based on the fact that damage to the immune system is associated with a complex set of interconnected factors, many of which cannot be clearly assessed, then is it reasonable to think that the selection of treatment options needs to be based more on the dysfunctions in immune system pathways, than on the potential triggers of the dysfunction?  Yes, that is correct.  There are any number of therapies â€“ both natural products and otherwise â€“ that could be put together to address immune system dysfunction. But, there is no simple fix. Physicians tend to want to just hand a patient an antidepressant, which is not going to work, or give Lyrica or pain medication, which is going to mask the problem. Even steroids mask the problem and prevent immune system functioning, and down the road a few years things are going to get even worse and spin out of control.  Treating these patients is a lot like the protocol we used for treating AIDS patients. If the AIDS patient had TB or mycoplasma we couldn\\'t treat the retrovirus first. We had to clear the terrain. We had to stop some of the other overwhelming infections and prevent the downstream effects on their bodies. Otherwise, they couldn\\'t respond to the treatment. What we learned that was most significant was to never let the CD4 T cells get too low, because if they get too low then patients can\\'t respond to antiretroviral or antimicrobial treatments.  We are also learning which microbes in the human microbiome are key to drug responses, because they modulate the immune system, interferon and things like that.  Most people want natural products for their illnesses. Baicalin, medical marijuana, vitamin D binding protein (GcMAF), and HEEL Lymphomyosot are some of the natural products that we have studied. The New Paradigm must Address Vaccines and Vaccine Injury  Big Pharma and the government scientists who do their will want us to believe that the science regarding vaccine safety is settled, and the current vaccination schedule is safe. However, some scientists object to this conclusion and insist that the science is not settled and the schedule is not safe!  In fact, the science that has been produced since 2010 concerning vaccines is unsettling Big Pharma. It contradicts their past conclusions and is threatening their profitability.  Agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have lost touch with their original mandates to protect and serve the public. These U.S. government regulators continue to ignore the new science and pursue an informal program that discredits scientists who expose the harmful nature of current vaccines, and they discredit those who dare to criticize the CDC\\'s recommended vaccine schedule.  As we saw with the MMR vaccine, the FDA knowingly approves vaccines and drugs when research shows a high potential for harm, and even destroys data and alters its findings for the sake of keeping its corporate funders happy. [4] While the FDA is keeping its head buried in the sand, the CDC is promoting a schedule of childhood vaccination which has caused harm to millions of children.  Despite this level of corruption, strong voices can be heard from outside the corporate and regulatory world declaring the truth about vaccines and their schedule of administration.  Among the voices raising concern about the safety of vaccines and their schedule of administration is the respectful voice of scientist Dr. Judy A. Mikovits, Ph.D. She continues to speak out on the mechanisms of immune system injury and the treatments for retroviral and vaccine related illness. Her clear voice is a wake-up call to all people who value health freedom and independent thinking.  Her teaching is life-enriching, because she is addressing the needs of real people with serious illness, and is speaking directly to doctors who are beginning to realize they need new tools to understand and treat the modern illnesses of their patients.  Her teaching is not anti-vaccine, because Dr. Mikovits is not anti-vaccine. However, Dr. Mikovits is not afraid to raise serious questions about the safety of the vaccines being used today. She is not afraid to give a strong warning about the vaccine schedule used for infants and children, and will not remain silent about the lack of wisdom associated with vaccinating pregnant women and seniors.  Dr. Mikovits allows the science to speak. She works hard to avoid standing on the pro-vaccine or anti-vaccine soapbox. Instead, she quietly asks us to use our intelligence to make decisions concerning the use of vaccines based on everything that is known about the functioning of the human immune system and its reaction to vaccines. Dr. Mikovits is Challenging All of Us to Wake Up  Dr. Mikovits is inserting a healthy dose of common sense into the discussion of vaccine safety. She stated:  You will hear, \"the science is settled, vaccines are safe.\" They aren\\'t safe. What science is settled? We learn new things every day!  Dr. Mikovits is challenging all of us to wake up.  Physicians are being challenged to think twice whenever they consider recommending that all their patients receive vaccines according to the schedule promoted by the CDC. The general public is being challenged to think twice before agreeing to receive vaccines or permit vaccines to be given to their children. Patients are being challenged to engage their physicians in a dialogue about the potential harm that might result from being vaccinated, because vaccine injury is a real possibility whenever a vaccine is given, and the use of clever marketing slogans such as \"the science is settled\" does not remove the possibility of vaccine injury.

Medical Doctors Opposed to Forced Vaccinations â€“ Should Their Views be Silenced? eBook â€“ Available for immediate download.  One of the biggest myths being propagated in the compliant mainstream media today is that doctors are either pro-vaccine or anti-vaccine, and that the anti-vaccine doctors are all \"quacks.\"  However, nothing could be further from the truth in the vaccine debate. Doctors are not unified at all on their positions regarding \"the science\" of vaccines, nor are they unified in the position of removing informed consent to a medical procedure like vaccines.  The two most extreme positions are those doctors who are 100% against vaccines and do not administer them at all, and those doctors that believe that ALL vaccines are safe and effective for ALL people, ALL the time, by force if necessary.  Very few doctors fall into either of these two extremist positions, and yet it is the extreme pro-vaccine position that is presented by the U.S. Government and mainstream media as being the dominant position of the medical field.  In between these two extreme views, however, is where the vast majority of doctors practicing today would probably categorize their position. Many doctors who consider themselves \"pro-vaccine,\" for example, do not believe that every single vaccine is appropriate for every single individual.  Many doctors recommend a \"delayed\" vaccine schedule for some patients, and not always the recommended one-size-fits-all CDC childhood schedule. Other doctors choose to recommend vaccines based on the actual science and merit of each vaccine, recommending some, while determining that others are not worth the risk for children, such as the suspect seasonal flu shot.  These doctors who do not hold extreme positions would be opposed to government-mandated vaccinations and the removal of all parental exemptions.  In this eBook, I am going to summarize the many doctors today who do not take the most extremist pro-vaccine position, which is probably not held by very many doctors at all, in spite of what the pharmaceutical industry, the federal government, and the mainstream media would like the public to believe.

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/the-four-reasons-for-assassination-of.html For me, this case is closed. John F. Kennedy was assassinated for stripping the Rothschild-owned Federal Reserve of its power to print and loan money to the United States Federal Government at interest. President Kennedy signed Executive Order No. 11110 on June 4, 1963, which returned to the U.S. government the power to issue currency, without going through the privately-owned Federal Reserve . Unknowingly, he also signed his death sentence that day. President Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963 and the United States Notes (backed by silver) he had issued were immediately taken out of circulation. Federal Reserve Notes continued to serve as the legal currency of the nation. You can read everything on the subject by following this link .But, it\\'s likely that at least three other factors have played a role in the decision to assassinate him and, later, other members of his family . 2. Not long before his death, President Kennedy famously stated: \"I will splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it into the winds.\" It is known that JFK fired CIA Director Allen Dulles and this book claims the latter is responsible for ordering the hit on the US President. 3. In a famous speech, JFK exposed the network of secret societies that operate against the American people and publicly opposed their devious ways of undermining mankind\\'s freedom. Just two years before he was assassinated (1961), JFK gave a really chilling â€” yet inspiring â€” speech, exposing secret societies. The warning is especially powerful because it came from a President in office: For me, this speech is remarkable especially because the Kennedys were part of the 13 \"elite\" families that rule the Earth from the shadows. These three facts are clearly showing that JFK declared war against the shadow \"elite\" and their network of secret societies. And for this reason, he and many other members of his lineage have paid the ultimate price . But he was not the only US President who gave us this warning: Former US Presidents and High Officials Warn About the \\'Invisible Government\\' Running the USA 4. Lastly, just ten days before his assassination, JFK asked for access to the UFO files. Based on evidence , the plot for JFK\\'s assassination was already set in motion when he asked to access the UFO files. In fact, new evidence suggests that Lee Harvey Oswald worked directly for Robert F. Kennedy and â€” shockingly â€” helped save JFK from an \\'assassination plot\\' three weeks earlier in Chicago . But, in so doing, he sealed his own fate. You can read more on the subject by accessing this link . But, even though JFK was already marked for assassination, demanding access to the UFO files could have expedited the efforts to take him out before he could succeed. The following article, wrote by Makia Freeman , makes a very strong case in support of this idea. Was JFK murdered mostly because he was trying to gain access to classified information on UFOs, ETs and aliens? As we approach the 53rd anniversary of the JFK assassination (which occurred on November 22, 1963) and mark the death of the greatest US president ever to challenge the New World Order Secret Government, it is worth briefly looking back in time to realize the tremendous lessons from the Kennedy murder. Last year in 2015 I released an in-depth 3-part series on the JFK assassination, dealing with the Who , How and Why of the event, which was a sacrificial mass ritual designed (among other things) to traumatize the American public. In part 3 I compiled a list of the various motives certain people and groups had to kill Kennedy. JFK had crossed the CIA, the Nazis, the Zionists, the Military Industrial Complex, the Federal Reserve and the Mafia â€“ all the while not being part of Secret Society Freemasonic brotherhood. However, was the ultimate reason he was killed due to his persistence and demands in obtaining top secret intelligence on the alien matter? Was JFK murdered because he challenged the power of Majestic-12 or MJ-12, the hidden group Truman had created to be the keepers of UFO and alien secrets? There is substantial evidence to indicate this is indeed the case. Released JFK Letters to CIA and NASA Show His Demand for UFO Files â€“ 10 Days Before His Death Two memos authored by Kennedy were released to researcher William Lester under FOIA (Freedom of Information Act). Both were written on November 12, 1963, just 10 days before JFK was murdered. One of them is a letter (pictured below) to CIA Director John McCone, who succeeded CIA Director Allen Dulles, one of the JFK assassination conspirators and masterminds (see part 1 ). In the memorandum with the subject \"Classification review of all UFO intelligent files affecting National Security\", JFK explicitly writes that he has initiated a joint space program with the USSR. He is telling the CIA that he wants to share its UFO, ET and alien data with NASA, and wants to distinguish between knowns and unknowns (we can interpret the \"knowns\" as US controlled secret technology such as anti-gravity craft and the \"unknowns\" as genuine extraterrestrial phenomena). Here is the text: \"As I had discussed with you previously, I have initiated [redacted] have instructed James Webb to develop a program with the Soviet Union in joint space and inner exploration. \"It would be very helpful if you would have the high threat cases reviewed with the purpose of identification of bona fide as opposed to classified CIA and USAF sources. \"It is important that we make a clear distinction between the knowns and unknowns in the event the Soviets try to mistake our extended cooperation as a cover for intelligence gathering of their defense and space programs. \"When this data has been sorted out, I would like you to arrange a program of data sharing with NASA where Unknowns are a factor. This will help NASA mission directors in their defensive responsibilities. \"I would like an interim report on the data review no later than February 1, 1964.\" The other memorandum (National Security Action Memorandum No. 271, pictured below) is addressed to then NASA administrator James Webb. It carries the subject line of \"Cooperation with the USSR on Outer Space Matters\". JFK outlines how he wants NASA to develop a program of cooperation with the Russians in the field of outer space. JFK Murdered Over UFO Intelligence Access â€“ The Bigger Picture However, to put these two memos in context, you need to understand that Kennedy had been chasing the golden goose for a long time. Authors and experts such as Dr. Michael Salla, Richard Hoagland and Mike Bara, some of whose work you can read here in \" President Kennedy\\'s deadly confrontation with the CIA & MJ-12 over ET/UFO X-Files â€“ Part II \", have done extensive research to show that JFK was determined, before his presidency even began, to get full UFO intelligence access and as president re-take control of the information. He wanted it out of military, unelected hands and placed back into civilian, elected ones. He was out to undo the damage Truman had done, and Eisenhower had continued, by setting up the hidden MJ-12 group in 1947 and keeping the UFO and alien subject under wraps as a giant secret. The following is from a review or synopsis of Salla\\'s book Kennedy\\'s Last Stand: Eisenhower, UFOs, MJ-12 and JFK\\'s Assassination : \"In searching for answers to who killed President Kennedy we need to start with the death of his mentor, James Forrestal in 1949. Forrestal became the first Secretary of Defense in 1947, a position he held until March, 1949. \"Forrestal was a visionary who thought Americans had a right to know about the existence of extraterrestrial life and technologies. \"Forrestal was sacked by President Truman because he was revealing the truth to various officials, including Kennedy who was a Congressman at the time. Forrestal\\'s ideals and vision inspired Kennedy, and laid the seed for what would happen 12 years later. \"After winning the 1960 Presidential election, Kennedy learned a shocking truth from President Eisenhower. The control group set up to run highly classified extraterrestrial technologies, Majestic-12, had become a rogue government agency. \"Eisenhower warned Kennedy that Majestic-12 had to be reined in. It posed a direct threat to American liberties and democratic processes. Kennedy followed Eisenhower\\'s advice, and set out to realize James Forrestal\\'s vision. \"The same forces that orchestrated Forrestal\\'s death, opposed Kennedy\\'s efforts at every turn. When Kennedy was on the verge of succeeding, by forcing the CIA to share classified UFO information with other government agencies on November 12, 1963, he was assassinated ten days later.\" Joint US-USSR Space Missions: JFK Murdered Over Clever Strategy Although JFK surely and naturally had other reasons for wanting to work together with the Soviets (and thus avoid any possibility of a nuclear war), it is quite possible that his proposed joint US-USSR program was an excuse and a clever means to wrest control of the ET issue from the hands of MJ-12. To have NASA cooperate with the Soviet space administration on lunar missions and outer space exploration would necessarily mean sharing data on UFOs. After all, the existence (and extreme technological capacity) of such craft were an obvious security factor and threat that would impact any space expedition. Kennedy already had Soviet leader Nikita Kruschchev on board. Salla writes : \"Documents confirm that on November 12, 1963 Kennedy and Khrushchev had agreed on steps to share UFO information precisely for this reason, and Kennedy identified the CIA as the lead U.S. agency to implement the process. \"Unknown to Kennedy, the CIA\\'s chief of counterintelligence, Angleton, implemented a secret set of directives that would deny access to classified UFO information to Kennedy, his national security staff and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\" The \"burned memo\" or MJ-12 Kennedy assassination directive The MJ-12 Kennedy Assassination Directive Truth is heavily guarded by layers of secrecy, deception, falsehood and propaganda. Often, government officials hide the truth by overseeing partial disclosures which are carefully orchestrated to give away just enough of the secret without going in too deep. Ever since the Roswell crash of 1947, the US Government kept 2 sets of UFO files. The tamer cases and less controversial information were made publicly available through Project Blue Book, which was the official public investigation into UFOs by the USAF. It formally ended in 1970. However, the really good stuff with high classifications was kept under lock and key by the CIA and MJ-12. Kennedy must have learnt enough about the situation to have known this, and have slowly but surely been making his way to the source of the information. By the time it got to November 12th, 1963, it was the final straw; MJ-12 who controlled the CIA would not allow Kennedy to have UFO intelligence access â€“ at any cost. As mentioned in part 3, the Kennedy assassination directive (pictured above) was written in code language to disguise the hit they were ordering. It uses the Russian spy term \"wet\" (i.e. wet from being drenched in fresh blood) to mean a killing. The memo reads:\"when conditions become nonconductive for growth in our environment and Washington cannot be influenced any further... it should be \\'wet.\\'\" This is from Salla\\'s commentary: \"Dr Robert Wood who is the foremost expert in analyzing MJ-12 documents using forensic methods, has concluded that the burned document is an assassination directive... he pointed out that the cryptic phrase \"it should be wet\" originates from Russia, where the phrase \\'wet works\\' or \"wet affairs\" denotes someone who had been killed and is drenched with blood. The codeword \\'wet\\' was later adopted by the Soviet KGB and other intelligence agencies... In drafting this cryptic directive, Allen Dulles was seeking approval from six of his MJ-12 colleagues, to lay the justification for the assassination of any elected or appointed official in Washington DC whose policies were \"non-conducive for growth\". The cryptic directive was a pre-authorization for the assassination of any U.S. President who could not \"be influenced any further\" to follow MJ-12 policies.\" CIA Wiretap of Marilyn Monroe Also Suggests JFK Murdered Over UFO Issue Popular actress Marilyn Monroe was a famous lover of both JFK and his brother Robert, who served as Attorney General in the Kennedy Administration. In April 2014, evidence came to light in the form of an alleged CIA transcription (pictured below). If real â€“ and it appears genuine â€“ it shows that the CIA were wiretapping Monroe and knew she was about to go public and blow the whistle on JFK and UFOs. Here is what the alleged CIA wiretap document (dated August 3, 1962) states: \"Rothberg indicated in so many words, that she [Monroe] had secrets to tell, no doubt arising from her trists [sic] with the President and the Attorney General. \"One such \"secret\" mentions the visit by the President at a secret air base for the purpose of inspecting things from outer space. 2. Subject repeatedly called the Attorney General and complained about the way she was being ignored by the President and his brother. 3. Subject threatened to hold a press conference and would tell all.\" CIA wiretap of Marilyn Monroe: more proof JFK murdered due to UFOs and aliens? Robert Kennedy Also Briefed On UFOs Another piece of evidence substantiating the \"JFK murdered due to UFOs\" hypothesis is that his brother and Attorney General Robert Kennedy was also briefed on the matter. Lieutenant Colonel Philip Corso, a man who served in a number of National Security Council committees from 1953-57 during the Eisenhower presidency, says Bobby actually sought him out. In this short video Corso says he personally briefed Bobby Kennedy on the subject of flying saucers or UFOs. Bobby was JFK\\'s closest advisor. Conclusion: Highly Likely JFK Murdered Over UFOs and ETs / Aliens So at the end of the day was JFK murdered over the UFOs and aliens? While there were many motives for (and conspirators involved in) the killing of JFK, the evidence is overwhelming that his demand for more control over the UFO and alien subject was the crucial factor in the decision by MJ-12 to assassinate him. It may have been the straw that broke the camel\\'s back, but more likely it was the central issue all along. JFK inherited a system from Eisenhower and Truman, US presidents who had already given away substantial control to the Military Industrial Intelligence Complex. Indeed, the very term \"Military Industrial Complex\" (MIC) has only become so commonplace thanks to Eisenhower using it in his farewell speech , where he issued a grave warning to the American public about the power that the MIC already held (but which he also allowed to a large extent). To study the New World Order and the worldwide conspiracy at the deepest levels is to study the UFO, ET and alien agenda. To study UFOs and aliens, in turn, is to accept the existence of free energy technology (aka zero point or over unity energy). This is the gamechanger . Once people accept the reality of free energy and learn how to create and share it, the control grid and conspiracy will evaporate â€“ because knowledgeable and abundant people cannot be controlled. There is so much at stake at here! Thank you JFK and to all others who have dedicated their lives to making this information public, widespread and accessible ! The truth cannot be hidden forever. Dear Friends, HumansAreFree is and will always be free to access and use. If you appreciate my work, please help me continue.  Stay updated via Email Newsletter: Related',\n",
              " 'IPet Goat And The Solar Flare In the video IPet Goat II, you see many symbols, some appear to represent celestial movements. In Egyptian mythology the planets and stars are shown in hieroglyphs as moving about on boats. In the film IPet Goat II, there is a figure riding on a boat which has been called Messianic by some viewers. However, I think this figure is a representation of the sun, he is very yellow, like the Simp(suns), he appears to be covered in flames and his hair looks distinctly like flames. He also seems to have sunspots on his face. Sunspots are quite distinct from ordinary spots.The reason I mention the Simp(suns) is that their eyes are designed to look like the circumpunct, a circle with a dot in the centre which represents the sun. [ link to en.wikipedia.org (secure) ] Also in the simpsons, Homer is obsessed with doughnuts and the torus is a doughnut shape that is seen throughout nature and space and has been the subject of much theorising by physicists such as Nassim Harramein.Sorry, back to IPet Goat II. The II in the title suggests it could be the symbol of Gemini. In the celestial realm the sun is currently moving through the sign of Gemini and will be moving to Wasat, a fixed star in the constellation and which appears to be where you might locate the phallus part of the constellation.You can see the phallus around the 4 min mark [ link to en.wikipedia.org (secure) ] This area is where the water signs are located in the sky. The sun moved through this area over the past few months.A little further in the video, just after the phallus scene, you see the sun produce either a massive solar flare or possibly an EMP which knocks out the grey men in the suits.Now I know there is much speculation about a possible celestial event and/or a financial collapse happening soon, perhaps these events have been foreshadowed by this video.The sun reaches the phallus around 11th July and if the video is prophetic, then we can expect some solar related event to happen very soon after that.This is the sun\\'s position on 11th July Re: IPet Goat And The Solar Flare \"The more you know, the crazier you look\" Report Copyright Violation Re: IPet Goat And The Solar Flare Maybe the Christ figure is a representation of you and your journey through this reality.

ISON Re: IPet Goat And The Solar Flare In the video IPet Goat II, you see many symbols, some appear to represent celestial movements. In Egyptian mythology the planets and stars are shown in hieroglyphs as moving about on boats. In the film IPet Goat II, there is a figure riding on a boat which has been called Messianic by some viewers. However, I think this figure is a representation of the sun, he is very yellow, like the Simp(suns), he appears to be covered in flames and his hair looks distinctly like flames. He also seems to have sunspots on his face. Sunspots are quite distinct from ordinary spots. The reason I mention the Simp(suns) is that their eyes are designed to look like the circumpunct, a circle with a dot in the centre which represents the sun. [ link to en.wikipedia.org (secure) ] Also in the simpsons, Homer is obsessed with doughnuts and the torus is a doughnut shape that is seen throughout nature and space and has been the subject of much theorising by physicists such as Nassim Harramein.Sorry, back to IPet Goat II. The II in the title suggests it could be the symbol of Gemini. In the celestial realm the sun is currently moving through the sign of Gemini and will be moving to Wasat, a fixed star in the constellation and which appears to be where you might locate the phallus part of the constellation.You can see the phallus around the 4 min mark [ link to en.wikipedia.org (secure) ] This area is where the water signs are located in the sky. The sun moved through this area over the past few months.A little further in the video, just after the phallus scene, you see the sun produce either a massive solar flare or possibly an EMP which knocks out the grey men in the suits.Now I know there is much speculation about a possible celestial event and/or a financial collapse happening soon, perhaps these events have been foreshadowed by this video.The sun reaches the phallus around 11th July and if the video is prophetic, then we can expect some solar related event to happen very soon after that.This is the sun\\'s position on 11th JulyI realise the video is around 3 years old but these events look like they are on the verge of happening this year, so I thought I would mention this.

              " 'Core Java Technologies Technical Tips View this issue as simple text September 10, 2002 In this Issue WELCOME to the Core JavaTM Technologies Tech Tips, September 10, 2002. Here you\\'ll get tips on using core Java technologies and APIs, such as those in Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SETM). Using ArrayList and LinkedList Using Zero-Length Arrays These tips were developed using Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, v 1.4. This issue of the JDC Tech Tips is written by Glen McCluskey. USING ARRAYLIST AND LINKEDLIST ArrayList and LinkedList are two Collections classes used for storing lists of object references. For example, you could have an ArrayList of Strings, or a LinkedList of Integers. This tip compares the performance of ArrayList and LinkedList, and offers some suggestions about which of these classes is the right choice in a given situation. The first key point is that an ArrayList is backed by a primitive Object array. Because of that, an ArrayList is much faster than a LinkedList for random access, that is, when accessing arbitrary list elements using the get method. Note that the get method is implemented for LinkedLists, but it requires a sequential scan from the front or back of the list. This scan is very slow. For a LinkedList, there\\'s no fast way to access the Nth element of the list. Consider the following example. Suppose you have a large list of sorted elements, either an ArrayList or a LinkedList. Suppose too that you do a binary search on the list. The standard binary search algorithm starts by checking the search key against the value in the middle of the list. If the middle value is too high, then the upper half of the list is eliminated. However, if the middle value is too low, then the lower half of the list is ignored. This process continues until the key is found in the list, or until the lower bound of the search becomes greater than the upper bound. Here\\'s a program that does a binary search on all the elements in an ArrayList or a LinkedList: import java.util.*; public class ListDemo1 { static final int N = 10000; static List values; // make List of increasing Integer values static { Integer vals[] = new Integer[N]; Random rn = new Random(); for (int i = 0, currval = 0; i = minval && indata[i] = minval && indata[i] <= maxval) { outdata[j++] = indata[i]; } } return outdata; } public static void main(String args[]) { // set up test array of integers int indata[] = new int[]{1, 3, -17, 8, 59}; // filter out values not in the range 1-10 int outdata1[] = filterData(indata, 1, 10); for (int i = 0; i < outdata1.length; i++) { System.out.println(outdata1[i]); } // filter out values not // in the range 100-200 int outdata2[] = filterData( indata, 100, 200); for (int i = 0; i < outdata2.length; i++) { System.out.println(outdata2[i]); } } } The filterData method does two scans of the input array. The first scan counts the number of valid data values. Then the method allocates a new array of the appropriate size, and copies the good values to it. If there are no good values, the method returns a null value for the array reference. The result of running the ZeroDemo1 program is: 1 3 8 Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.NullPointerException at ZeroDemo1.main(ZeroDemo1.java:72) The problem with this program is a rather basic one. The second call of filterData returns a null value, and the program fails to take this possibility into account. A better approach in this example would be to comment out the block of code that tests for the possibility of no valid data values: /* if (validcnt == 0) { return null; } */ When there is no valid data, the code will fall through to the next line, where a zero-length array is allocated: int outdata[] = new int[0]; This is perfectly legal Java usage. The representation of Java arrays includes the length of the array, and it\\'s therefore possible to tell if an array has zero length. For the ZeroDemo1 example, if you anticipate that validcnt will often be zero, that is, data filtering will often eliminate all values from the input, then you could optimize away the second input scan by adding code like this: int outdata[] = new int[validcnt]; if (validcnt == 0) { return outdata; } Note that usage such as: int outdata[] = new int[]{}; is also legal, to initialize an array with a zero-length set of integer constants. In general, it\\'s best not to return null from a method that returns an array type. Always returning an array, even if the array has zero length, greatly improves the generality of algorithms. If you anticipate that your methods will often return zero-length arrays, you might be concerned about the performance implications of allocating many such arrays. In this case, you can allocate a single array, and always return the same one, as follows: private static final int ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAY[] = new int[0]; This array is immutable (it can\\'t be changed), and can be shared throughout your application. There\\'s another way that zero-length arrays are used, as illustrated in the following example: import java.util.*; public class ZeroDemo2 { public static void main(String args[]) { // set up ArrayList and add strings to it List stringlist = new ArrayList(); stringlist.add(\"string 1\"); stringlist.add(\"string 2\"); stringlist.add(\"string 3\"); // convert to String array String out[] = ( String[])stringlist.toArray( new String[0]); for (int i = 0; i < out.length; i++) { System.out.println(out[i]); } } } The result of running the ZeroDemo2 program is: string 1 string 2 string 3 The ZeroDemo2 program sets up an ArrayList, and adds three strings to it. Then the program calls toArray to get a String array of the three elements in the ArrayList. In this example, the argument to toArray is \"new String[0]\". This argument serves a couple of purposes. First, if you have a String array that\\'s big enough to hold the elements of the ArrayList, you can specify it as the argument to toArray. The method will use the String array. But if your array is not big enough, then the toArray method allocates an array to return the elements. It uses the type of the array that was passed in to determine the type of the allocated array. ArrayList stores its element references in an Object array. The toArray method needs to be told if there is some other type (such as String) to be used for returning the array of elements. The method uses reflection (java.lang.reflect.Array.newInstance) to create an array of the appropriate type.

              " 'Trump Campaign missed the deadline to remove William Johnson as a delegate [Media preview] ________________________________ From: Sarge, Matthew Sent: Tuesday, May 10, 2016 8:35 PM To: Comm_D Subject: Mother Jones: Trump Campaign Corresponded With Its White Nationalist Delegate Long After \"Database Error\" Trump Campaign Corresponded With Its White Nationalist Delegate Long After \"Database Error\" On Tuesday, Mother Jones broke the story that the Trump campaign had selected William Johnson, a prominent white nationalist leader, as a California delegate. The Trump campaign responded with the following statement: Yesterday the Trump campaign submitted its list of California delegates to be certified by the Secretary of State of California. A database error led to the inclusion of a potential delegate that had been rejected and removed from the campaign\\'s list in February 2016. Reached again by Mother Jones late Tuesday, Johnson said he would resign as a delegate if asked to do so by the campaign. \"I accept Trump\\'s explanation,\" he said, regarding the statement. \"I don\\'t want to gainsay the Trump campaign. If I am not removed from the database, I will resign.\" Although the Trump campaign blamed a \"database error\" for including Johnson as a delegate, the campaign corresponded with him personally just over 24 hours ago. Trump\\'s California delegate coordinator, Katie Lagomarsino, sent Johnson a congratulatory email on Monday, and when he asked for clarification about how to send his completed pledge form back to the campaign, she replied. Here is the email exchange (with the personal contact information redacted by Mother Jones): [ Mother Jones also has a copy of the pledge form discussed in the email exchange, which Johnson signed and sent to the Trump campaign on Monday. You can see his pledge here . ________________________________ From: Sarge, Matthew Sent: Tuesday, May 10, 2016 4:04 PM To: Comm_D Subject: Mother Jones: Trump Selects a White Nationalist Leader as a Delegate in California h/t Joel We have a fair amount on William Johnson and his Pro-Trump American National Super PAC running robocalls in Iowa Trump Selects a White Nationalist Leader as a Delegate in California On Monday evening, California\\'s secretary of state published a list of delegates chosen by the Trump campaign for the upcoming Republican presidential primary in the state. Trump\\'s slate includes William Johnson, one of the country\\'s most prominent white nationalists. Johnson applied to the Trump campaign to be a delegate. He was accepted on Monday. In order to be approved he had to sign this pledge sent to him by the campaign: \"I, William Johnson, endorse Donald J. Trump for the office of President of the United States. I pledge to cast ALL of my ballots to elect Donald J. Trump on every round of balloting at the 2016 Republican National Convention so that we can MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" After he signed, the Trump campaign added his name to the list of 169 delegates it forwarded to the secretary of state. Johnson leads the American Freedom Party, a group that \"exists to represent the political interests of White Americans\" and aims to preserve \"the customs and heritage of the European American people.\" The AFP has never elected a candidate of its own and possesses at most a few thousand members, but it is \"arguably the most important white nationalist group in the country,\" according to Mark Potok, a senior fellow for the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which tracks hate groups. Johnson got the news that he had been selected by Trump in a congratulatory email sent to him by the campaign\\'s California Delegate Coordinator, Katie Lagomarsino. \"I just hope to show how I can be mainstream and have these views,\" Johnson tellsMother Jones. \"I can be a white nationalist and be a strong supporter of Donald Trump and be a good example to everybody.\" Johnson says that in his application to be a GOP delegate for Trump he disclosed multiple details about his background and activism, though he did not specifically use the term \"white nationalist.\" The Trump campaign and Lagomarsino did not respond to requests for comment. Whether or not Johnson was vetted by the Trump campaign, the GOP front-runner would have a hard time claiming ignorance of Johnson\\'s extreme views: Johnson has gained notice during the presidential primary for funding pro-Trump robocalls that convey a white nationalist message. \"The white race is dying out in America and Europe because we are afraid to be called \\'racist,\\'\" Johnson says in one robocall pushed out to residential landlines in Vermont and Minnesota. \"â€¦Donald Trump is not racist, but Donald Trump is not afraid. Don\\'t vote for a Cuban. Vote for Donald Trump.\" Armed with cash from affluent donors and staffed by what the movement considers to be its top thinkers, the AFP now dedicates most of its resources to supporting Trumpâ€”and for good reason: Johnson claims the AFP\\'s pro-Trump robocalls, which have delivered Johnson\\'s personal cellphone number to voters in seven states, have helped the party find hundreds of new members. \"[Trump] is allowing us to talk about things we\\'ve not been able to talk about,\" Johnson says. \"So even if he is not elected, he has achieved great things.\" On numerous occasions, Trump has failed to forcefully repudiate this sort of support. After being endorsed by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke in August last year, Trump simply told Bloomberg News, \"I don\\'t need his endorsement; I certainly wouldn\\'t want his endorsement. I don\\'t need anybody\\'s endorsement.\" Asked in February about the robocalls, which are funded by Johnson through a super-PAC, a Trump spokeswoman would only tell CNN that the candidate had \"disavowed all super-PACs offering their support.\" The SPLC\\'s Potok argues that Trump has \"legitimized and mainstreamed hate\" in ways we haven\\'t seen since the days of George Wallace. Though nobody can say for sure how many people belong to America\\'s largest hate groups, the SPLC has found that the number of such groups grew by 14 percent in 2015, reversing years of declines. Potok worries that Trump could fuel the spread of the AFP\\'s ideas for years to come. Johnson is a corporate lawyer who grows persimmons and raises chickens at his 67-acre \"ranch\" in a Los Angeles suburb. When I met him recently outside his law office in downtown LA\\'s World Trade Center, he was in high spirits. He suggested brightly that we walk downstairs to get lunch at a nearby Korean restaurant. As we sat next to a table of immaculately coiffed Korean Air flight attendants, I mentioned that some might find it surprising that a guy who wrote a book advocating the creation of an all-white ethno-state was eating a plate of bulgogi beef with kimchee. \"Koreans don\\'t have to make Korean food,\" he said matter-of-factly. \"One of the best Chinese restaurants I went to in the Bay Area is owned by a Mormon and cooked by a Mormon. Really great Chinese food.\" Short, graying, and 61 years old, Johnson favors pressed white shirts and bookish black-framed glasses. He grew up in predominantly white neighborhoods in Arizona and Oregon before moving to Japan in 1974 to study the language. It was there that locals engaged him in \"open\" discussions about differences between the races, and he came to see America\\'s European heritage as its biggestâ€”and most vulnerableâ€”asset. (This trajectory is not uncommon: Jared Taylor, head of the white nationalist group American Renaissance, also speaks fluent Japanese, and Aryan Nations founder Richard Butler became a white supremacist while immersed in the caste system in India.) In 1985, Johnson published, under a pseudonym, Amendment to the Constitution: Averting the Decline and Fall of America, a book calling for the abolition of the 14th and 15th Amendments and the deportation of all nonwhites. He tried to sound a practical tone, allowing, for instance, that African Americans should receive \"a rich dowry to enable them to prosper in their homeland.\" The book was a hit on the talk show circuit, and Johnson suddenly found himself appearing on television alongside neo-Nazi skinheads and Klansmen. By 1989, his notoriety and clean-cut appeal convinced a group of white nationalists in Wyoming to tap him to run for Dick Cheney\\'s vacant congressional seat. He garnered a flurry of press coverage when he earned enough signatures to qualify for the ballot; around the same time, the building housing his California law office was bombed. Johnson says the FBI accused him of detonating it himself in a bid for more press. (The bureau declined to comment.) Twenty years later, after unsuccessfully running for various other offices, Johnson became the head of the American Freedom Party (then known as American Third Position), at the request of a group of Southern California skinheads. Johnson\\'s post was supposed to be temporary: \"The skinheads thought I was too extreme to run the organization,\" he explained. But they were the ones who ended up dropping out, replaced by what has become a sort of white nationalist brain trust: Party leaders now include a former Reagan administration appointee and a professor emeritus at California State University-Long Beach. After our Korean lunch, Johnson rushed back up to his office to host the latest episode of For God and Country, a Christian AM talk show currently broadcast in California, Louisiana, and Texas. His Filipino American co-host, the Rev. Ronald Tan, nodded approvingly as Johnson praised Trump on the air for \"busting up the concept of political correctness.\" The show allows Johnson to push a Trump-centric version of white nationalism to a potentially receptive audienceâ€”up to a point. Several radio stations in Iowa recently canceled the program out of objection to its content. During a commercial break, Johnson fidgeted. \"Are you going to quote any more Scriptures?\" he asked Tan nervously. \"Has the station said that we\\'re not Christian enough?\" Back on the air, Tan pivoted to 1 Samuel 16, comparing Trump to King David. In addition to promoting Trump on the radio and over the phone, the AFP streams a podcast called the Daily Trump Phenomenon Hour. It has set up a \"political harassment hotline\" for Trump supporters who wish to consult with an attorney about being attacked or verbally abused by anti-Trump protesters. Johnson has personally spent $30,000 the Trump promotions, including $18,000 for the party. The robocalls, the radio show, and the \"harassment hotline\" were all things that Johnson mentioned in his application to become a Trump delegate. He specifically cited an anti-Romney robocall commissioned in Utah this past March, which begins, in part, \"My name is William Johnson. I am a farmer and a white nationalist.\" After wrapping up the radio show, Johnson led me through his office, where a brush-painted screen hangs alongside shelves stacked with Japanese books and dictionaries. Many of his legal clients, it turns out, are foreigners who speak English as a second language. Yet Johnson says he sees no problem with Trump\\'s isolationist foreign policy, even if it hurts his businessâ€”ideally, he\\'d like to give up his practice and serve as Trump\\'s secretary of agriculture. We ended up in a mirrored conference room to meet with three AFP sympathizers, two middle-aged women and a young man. They talked about how Trump had enabled a new kind of \"honest discourse,\" how he wasn\\'t a racist but a \"racialist,\" and how he had left them feeling \"emancipated.\" Johnson also now finds it easier to be himself: \"For many, many years, when I would say these things, other white people would call me names: \\'Oh, you\\'re a hatemonger, you\\'re a Nazi, you\\'re like Hitler,\\'\" he confessed. \"Now they come in and say, \\'Oh, you\\'re like Donald Trump.\\'\"',\n",

When I first joined the NSM I knew it would be something I would stick with the rest of my life. It was not a club, a gang, or some fleeting thrill for the moment: it was a commitment to a way of life, and a direct link to many of our Forefathers who fought for Blood and Soil. Fellow Party members, most of you have taken the Oath of Loyalty to the Party, and those that have not yet taken your Oath, as read in the membership handbook, are expected to do so as soon as possible. It is a commitment, and proves you are serious about helping us to bring about changes in our Nation. It also creates Solidarity, and Kinship with your fellow Brothers and Sisters in our struggle. In this modern day materialistic Society to some an Oath, or pledge of Loyalty means nothing. For those of us that live by the Old Ways, breaking an Oath defiles your Honor, and leaves you with nothing but an empty shell that once held your life force. If a man cannot stay true to his Oath, then he is no man but rather a castrated maggot devoid of any trace of purity or an Aryan Soul. Your Oath also holds you to the battlefield, until this fight for our Race and Nation has been won. Members of the SS swear Loyalty to the FÃ¼hrer I often reflect about so-called Comrades that have abandoned their Oaths to the Party, and I wonder how they can live with themselves, as the rest of us face such a large scale enemy in Zog, and they give up without a fight, or before the fight is finished. We at Party HQ always hear a multitude of excuses from the Oath breakers. Sometimes their reasons are based in serious issues (still there is no reason serious enough to break your Oath) but more often than not it is trivial matters, such as personal problems with another member, so and so had their feelings hurt, or this or that person was not thanked enough for their work, or did not get promoted, or did not like a certain rule in the chain of command, or Religion, or insert excuse here ____. These same Oath breakers often claim to take great pride in the 3rd Reich, and CLAIM they are National Socialists. Truth be known, had they lived during the 3rd Reich and broke their Party Oaths there, especially in the war years, they might have met the hanging Judge Roland Freisler, and be dangling from piano wire! It comes down to this Comrades, and prospective Party members. If you are not serious about our Party leave now. I am opening the door now for any current member to leave, with their Oath intact. I want to shake out any of the uncommitted, non-serious members right now, considering they are not needed as we move forward to the frontlines. To the Prospects and Probate NSM members, this message is for you also. If you are not in this fight with us to the bitter end, now would be the time to walk away. Furthermore, the NSM does not operate as a Democracy: your pledge of Loyalty is to the Party and its Leadership. Honor your Oath, and your Pledge of Loyalty to the Party, or get out of our Ranks now while you still can! To the rest of you, the Party Faithful, the Warrior Archetypes, you men and women forged in Iron and steel ready to stand against the Zionist hordes, and their beloved illegal slave laborers: Your Party Salutes and Honors you! Providence has already promised us Victory in our fight, and your Ancestors march alongside you. In spirit, the men who fought at Valley Forge stand alongside of us, as do the brave men of the Alamo, as do the thousands that perished on the Eastern Front fighting Communism, and every other meaningful battle where our Racial Kinfolk have sacrificed their lives. Let those who abandon us, and break their Oaths, run away quickly with their tails between their legs. If they can live with that shame and dishonor, so be it. For the rest of us, Duty calls! Commander Jeff SchoepNational Socialist Movement A message from Director of the Media dept. of NSM 88!To all National Socialist Movement membership. Over the last several weeks we have heard from the Commander regarding the subjects of honor, duty, our oaths, and the proper behavior of a Comrade. We are a National Socialist organization, not a democracy, nor a social club, not a collection of individuals, but a united force for our volk. A NS organization is run on the Fuhrerprizip, a concept brought to us from our ancestors--trust and obedience to your superiors, responsibly and service to those in your command. For too long some amongst us have forgotten that no one individual is important, as our Fuhrer instructs, but that we are all in service to our volk. I personally, and on behalf of my state of Wisconsin, support all decisions of our Commander, who acts to unify us all in service to the movement that is the only hope for our people. We have been through hard times before my Comrades, and will again many times before all is said and done. From experience, we know that the mud slinging will be fast and furious, pay no mind. Accept information only from true sources, the rest is garbage. I am proud to be among you all, and to call you my brothers and sisters!M Sgt JohnsonWisconsin State LeaderDirector of NSM Media NSM/ MO. Statement: I have been asked to make a statement on behalf of NSM Missouri, although it is ridiculous that I anyone should have to say anything at all. Let me state unequivocally that the entire state of Missouri is behind the Commander 100%. Jeff Schoep has been a good friend as well as leader for a long time. The NSM is growing exponentially as is the state of Missouri. Much, if not all of that, is due to his leadership. Commander Schoep is exactly right - this is not a democracy. We are National Socialists. We recognise the Fuhrerprinzip. Fall in line or get out! I feel stupid even making this statement as only four people have left the party. Three of them were expelled and the fourth was the best friend and assistant of one of the expelled members! This kind of thing has gone on forever. Every political party does this (look at the republicrats). It happened in the NSDAP. It happened in the ANP. It is not unusual, strange, or unheard of. But one thing is certainly true: it is long overdue that we should put our petty individual egos/disagreements/problems aside and get on with the epic, monumental, historic, and absolutely mandatory task of saving our Race. Heil Hitler! MSgt. Steven Boswell NSM MissouriA number of other NSM Leaders have also issued similar statements, however this is more than enough to put this issue in its casket.

              " 'in: Medical & Health , Multimedia , Natural Medicine , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests Cannabis contains a compound that may kill brain cancers that chemotherapy and radiation can\\'t touch, so why isn\\'t it being used today? In recent years, we\\'ve focused heavily on educating our readers about the still relatively unknown role that cancer stem cells play in cancer, both in terms of conventional cancer treatment failure and the exceptionally promising role that natural interventions play in targeting these highly malignant cells. It is encouraging to witness a growing awareness that cancer has been completely misunderstood , and that in order to make progress against the global epidemic we will have to go back to the wisdom of the ancients by using foods and spices instead of toxic chemicals and radiation to fight a disease that should be classified more as a survival mechanism unmasked than an inexorably lethal, genetically-driven condition . Even the National Cancer Institute now admits that it had been wrong for decades about \"early stage\" breast ( DCIS ) and prostate (HGPIN) \"cancers,\" and that they should be reclassified as indolent or benign lesions of epithelial origin, i.e. not \"cancer\" at all! Essentially, therefore, millions were overdiagnosed and overtreated for cancers they never had. Even now, despite this admission, the vast majority of conventional doctors have yet to account for, acknowledge, or integrate this radically different definition of cancer and its implications for treatment into their \"standard of care.\" Only last week, we featured a new review on natural therapies that target cancer stem cells , many of which included common foods and spices. You can view it here. But one substance conspicuously absent from the list was cannabis , which is the herb we now turn to to give it a fair representation in the context of this topic. A recent article published in the Journal Neuroimmune Pharmacology titled, \" The Antitumor Activity of Plant-Derived Non-Psychoactive Cannabinoids ,\" reviewed the therapeutic potential of a non-psychoactive class of phytochemicals found in cannabis known as cannabinoids . Unlike THC, cannabinoids do not activate the cannabinoid 1 and cannabinoid 2 receptors in the central nervous system in any significant way, making their activity less controversial as they do not produce changes in perception and sensation associated with \"recreational\" and/or \"psychedelic\" drugs. There are actually over 60 cannabinoids in cannabis, but the second most abundant one, cannabidiol (CBD), has been found to inhibit and/or kill a wide range of cancers in the animal model, including gliobastoma (a difficult-to-treat type of brain cancer), breast, lung, prostate, and colon cancer. There have been a wide range of mechanisms identified behind these observed anti-tumor activities, including anti-angiogenic (preventing new blood vessel formation), anti-metastatic, anti-cell viability, but the one we wish to focus on in this report is its ability to to inhibit the stem-like potential of cancer cells. Stem cells are unique within the body as they are capable of continual self-renewal, theoretically making them immortal relative to regular body cells (somatic cells), which die after a fixed number or replication cycles. In their normal state of function they are essential for healing and bodily regeneration, as they are capable of differentiating into the wide range of cells that make up the body and need to be regularly replaced when damaged. This so-called pluripotent property of stem cells is also observed in tumor formation and maintenance, as cancer stem cells are capable of producing the entire range of different cells that make up a tumor colony. Unlike regular tumor cells, cancer stem cells are uniquely tumorigenic because they are capable of breaking off from an existing lesion or tumor and forming a new tumor colony of cells. In this sense, they are \"mother cells\" at the heart of cancer malignancy, whose ability to colonize other tissues by producing all the \"daughter cells\" necessary to form a new tumor make their existence highly concerning from the perspective of cancer prevention and treatment. Radiation and chemotherapy, while capable of reducing the size of a tumor, actually enrich the post-treatment residual lesion or tumor with higher levels of cancer stem cells , and in some cases transform non-cancer stem cells into cancer stem cells , ultimately making the post-treatment state of the treated tissue far worse than its pre-treatment condition. This is why identifying and using natural, safe, effective and affordable ways to target cancer stem cells versus the non-tumorigenic tumor cells in a lesion or tumor is the only rational way to treat cancer, and should be the primary focus of present day cancer treatment approaches. The new review discussed the way that cannabidiol targets and/or inhibits the cancer stem cell subpopulation in cancers such as the highly treatment-resistant form of brain cancer known as glioblastoma, which is widely considered by conventional medicine as \"incurable.\" A 2013 study, 1 mentioned in the review, found that patient-derived glioblastoma cells when exposed to cannabidiol saw a significant down-regulation of the genetic tumor marker Id-1, which has been closely correlated with brain cancer cell invasiveness. They also found that cannabidiol was capable of inhibiting neurosphere formation (a sign of cancer stem cell tumor formation), as well as was capable of inhibiting glioblastoma tumor invasiveness in an animal model. The results of this preclinical study were so compelling that the researchers concluded cannibidiol might make an ideal adjunct treatment: With its lack of systemic toxicity and psychoactivity, cannabidiol is an ideal candidate agent in this regard and may prove useful in combination with front-line agents for the treatment of patients with aggressive and high-grade glioblastoma tumors. Integrative approaches often focus on using natural interventions as \"adjuncts\" to conventional, inherently toxic approaches like chemotherapy and radiation, we believe that another possibility exists, namely, that cannabidiol in combination with a wide range of other natural substances studied for targeting glioblastoma is more effective (and certainly far safer) than a combination approach. To view other anti-glioblastoma substances, view our database on the subject . Another highly relevant study published in 2007 titled, \"Cannabinoids induce glioma stem-like cell differentiation and inhibit gliomagenesis,\" 2 found that cannabinoids target the stem-like properties of glioma cells, encouraging their differentiation into functioning, non-tumorigenic cells, and inhibiting the dysregulated increased production of glioma cells. A more recent 2015 study, 3 found that glioblastoma cells treated with cannabidiol inhibited their self-renewal by down-regulating \"critical stem cell maintenance and growth regulators.\" Another study, published last month, found that cannabidiol inhibits glioma stem-like proliferation by inducing autophagy, a natural form of programmed cell death. 4 Consider, finally, that the cancer stem cell targeting and killing properties of cannabidiol are only one of a wide range of potential mechanisms through which cannabis as a whole plant, comprised of hundreds of different phytochemicals and phytonutrients, can treat cancer. We have indexed hundreds of studies on cannabis\\' therapeutic properties, a good subset concerning its ability to prevent, kill, or regress a wide range of different cancer types. You can view them all on our cannabis research database . Research on cannabis and brain cancer has only just begun, but considering the abject failure if not also sheer violence of conventional approaches, waiting for sufficient quantities of Pharma or government capital to flow in the direction of a non-patentable substance already saddled with archaic laws in some cases criminalizing its possession is a no win proposition. Anecdotes of healing with cannabis are not uncommon. One such report can be viewed on our colleague Dr. Jeffrey Dach\\'s website, titled, \" Cannabis Oil Brain Tumor Remission ,\" demonstrating just how powerful cannabis and its cannabinoids may be for accomplishing what conventional approaches can not. A couple years ago, we reported on a similar case of temporary remission in childhood leukemia using cannabis extract . Also, consider reports like this one, where a woman clearly being victimized by conventional medicine was able to replace 40 different medications through using raw cannabis juice . The short of it is that the future of medicine , if it is to continue to advertise itself to be concerned with alleviating human suffering and being guided by \"evidence,\" must incorporate this safe, time-tested, affordable and effective healing agent into its standard of care. Failing to do so will not de-validate cannabis, rather, but the medical system itself. One might ask, if cannabis can treat \"incurable\" brain cancers, and is safer and more effective than chemotherapy and radiation, shouldn\\'t withholding it or information about its healing properties be considered criminal? Instead we still live in a time and age where simply possessing it or using it is in some jurisdictions classified as a criminal offense of dire if not irreparable consequence to our civil liberties. Perhaps we are at a critical turning point now and the aforementioned research will lead us all forward to a more enlightened medical ethos that respects the right of a patient to choose his or her treatment as long as it does no harm to others.

              " 'President Trump loves to set the day\\'s narrative at dawn, but the deeper story of his White House is best told at night. Aides confer in the dark because they cannot figure out how to operate the light switches in the cabinet room. Visitors conclude their meetings and then wander around, testing doorknobs until finding one that leads to an exit. In a darkened, mostly empty West Wing, Mr. Trump\\'s provocative chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, finishes another day planning new lines of attack. Usually around 6:30 p. m. or sometimes later, Mr. Trump retires upstairs to the residence to recharge, vent and intermittently use Twitter. With his wife, Melania, and young son, Barron, staying in New York, he is almost always by himself, sometimes in the protective presence of his imposing longtime aide and former security chief, Keith Schiller. When Mr. Trump is not watching television in his bathrobe or on his phone reaching out to old campaign hands and advisers, he will sometimes set off to explore the unfamiliar surroundings of his new home. During his first two dizzying weeks in office, Mr. Trump, an outsider president working with a surprisingly small crew of no more than a empowered aides with virtually no familiarity with the workings of the White House or federal government, sent shock waves at home and overseas with a succession of executive orders designed to fulfill campaign promises and taunt foreign leaders. \"We are moving big and we are moving fast,\" Mr. Bannon said, when asked about the upheaval of the first two weeks. \"We didn\\'t come here to do small things. \" But one thing has become apparent to both his allies and his opponents: When it comes to governing, speed does not always guarantee success. The bungled rollout of his executive order barring immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries, a flurry of other miscues and embarrassments, and an approval rating lower than that of any comparable president in the history of polling have Mr. Trump and his top staff rethinking an improvisational approach to governing that mirrors his chaotic presidential campaign, administration officials and Trump insiders said. This account of the early days of the Trump White House is based on interviews with dozens of government officials, congressional aides, former staff members and other observers of the new administration, many of whom requested anonymity. At the center of the story, according to these sources, is a president determined to go big but increasingly frustrated by the efforts of his small team to contain the backlash. \"What are we going to do about this?\" Mr. Trump pointedly asked an aide last week, a period of turmoil briefly interrupted by the successful rollout of his Supreme Court selection, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch. Chris Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and an old friend of the president\\'s, said: \"I think, in his mind, the success of this is going to be the poll numbers. If they continue to be weak or go lower, then somebody\\'s going to have to bear some responsibility for that. \" \"I personally think that they\\'re missing the big picture here,\" Mr. Ruddy said of Mr. Trump\\'s staff. \"Now he\\'s so caught up, the administration is so caught up in turmoil, perceived chaos, that the Democrats smell blood, the protesters, the media smell blood. \" One former staff member likened the aggressive approach of the first two weeks to but said the president\\'s team had stormed the beaches without any plan for a longer war. Clashes among staff are common in the opening days of every administration, but they have seldom been so public and so pronounced this early. \"This is a president who came to Washington vowing to shake up the establishment, and this is what it looks like. It\\'s going to be a little sloppy, there are going to be conflicts,\" said Ari Fleischer, President George W. Bush\\'s first press secretary. All this is happening as Mr. Trump, a man of flexible ideology but fixed habits, adjusts to a new job, life and city. Cloistered in the White House, he now has little access to his fans and supporters â€” an important source of feedback and validation â€” and feels increasingly pinched by the pressures of the job and the constant presence of protests, one of the reasons he was forced to scrap a planned trip to Milwaukee last week. For a sense of what is happening outside, he watches cable, both at night and during the day â€” too much in the eyes of some aides â€” often offering a bitter of critics like CNN\\'s Don Lemon. Until the past few days, Mr. Trump was telling his friends and advisers that he believed the opening stages of his presidency were going well. \"Did you hear that, this guy thinks it\\'s been terrible!\" Mr. Trump said mockingly to other aides when one dissenting view was voiced last week during a West Wing meeting. But his opinion has begun to change with a relentless parade of bad headlines. Mr. Trump got away from the White House this weekend for the first time since his inauguration, spending it in Palm Beach, Fla. at his private club, posting Twitter messages angrily â€” and in personal terms â€” about the federal judge who put a nationwide halt on the travel ban. Mr. Bannon and Reince Priebus, the two clashing power centers, traveled with him. By then, the president, for whom chains of command and policy minutiae rarely meant much, was demanding that Mr. Priebus begin to put in effect a much more conventional White House protocol that had been taken for granted in previous administrations: From now on, Mr. Trump would be looped in on the drafting of executive orders much earlier in the process. Another change will be a new set of checks on the previously unfettered power enjoyed by Mr. Bannon and the White House policy director, Stephen Miller, who oversees the implementation of the orders and who received the brunt of the internal and public criticism for the rollout of the travel ban. Mr. Priebus has told Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon that the administration needs to rethink its policy and communications operation in the wake of embarrassing revelations that key details of the orders were withheld from agencies, White House staff and Republican congressional leaders like Speaker Paul D. Ryan. Mr. Priebus has also created a checklist for the release of any new initiatives that includes signoff from the communications department and the White House staff secretary, Robert Porter, according to several aides familiar with the process. Mr. Priebus bristles at the perception that he occupies a diminished perch in the West Wing pecking order compared with previous chiefs. But for the moment, Mr. Bannon remains the president\\'s dominant adviser, despite Mr. Trump\\'s anger that he was not fully briefed on details of the executive order he signed giving his chief strategist a seat on the National Security Council, a greater source of frustration to the president than the fallout from the travel ban. It is partly because he is seen as having a clear vision on policy. But it is also because others who had been expected to fill major roles have been less confident in asserting their power. Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\\'s occupies a central role in the administration and has been present at most major decisions and photo ops, but he is a father of young children who has taken to life in Washington, and, along with his wife, Ivanka Trump, has already been spotted at events around town. Mr. Bannon has rushed into the vacuum, telling allies that he and Mr. Miller have a brief window in which to push through their vision of Mr. Trump\\'s economic nationalism. Mr. Bannon, whose website, Breitbart, was a magnet for white nationalists and xenophobic speech, has also tried to reassure official Washington. He has been careful to build bridges with the Republican establishment, especially Mr. Ryan â€” whom he once described as \"the enemy\" and vowed to force out. He now talks regularly with Mr. Ryan to coordinate strategy or plot their planned overhaul of the tax code. Before he was ousted in November as transition chief, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, the Trump adviser with the most government experience, helped prepare a detailed staffing and implementation plan in line with the kickoff strategies of previous Republican presidents. It was discarded â€” a senior Trump aide made a show of tossing it into a garbage can â€” for a strategy that prioritized the daily release of dramatic executive orders to put opponents on the defensive. Mr. Christie, who agrees in principle with the broad strokes of Mr. Trump\\'s immigration policy, says the president has been let down by his staff. \"The president deserves better than the rollout he got on the immigration executive order,\" Mr. Christie said. \"The fact is that he\\'s put forward a policy that, in my opinion, is significantly more effective than what he had proposed during the campaign, yet because of the botched implementation, they allowed his opponents to attack him by calling it a Muslim ban. \" In the past few days, Mr. Trump\\'s team has stressed its cohesion and the challenges of an administration that few outside its group ever thought would exist. \"This team spent months in the foxhole together during the campaign,\" said Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. \"We moved into the White House as a unified team committed to enacting the president\\'s agenda. \" As part of Mr. Trump\\'s Oval Office renovation, he ordered that four hardback chairs be placed in a semicircle around his Resolute Desk now heaped, in Trump Tower fashion, with memos and newspapers. They are an emblem of Mr. Trump\\'s management style, but also a reminder that in the White House, the seats always outlast the people seated in them. But finding enough skilled players to fill key slots has not been easy: Mr. Spicer is serving double duty as communications director, a key planning position, in addition to engaging in combat with the news media. Mr. Trump, several aides said, is used to quarterbacking his own media strategy, and did not see the value of hiring an outsider. An early plan was to give the communications job to Kellyanne Conway, his former campaign manager and top TV surrogate, but the demands of the job would have conflicted with Ms. Conway\\'s other duties as a adviser to Mr. Trump with Oval Office privileges, according to one aide. Mr. Trump remains intensely focused on his brand, but the demands of the job mean he spends less time monitoring the news media â€” although he recently upgraded the TV in his private dining room so he can watch the news while eating lunch. He often has to wait until the end of the workday before grinding through news clips with Mr. Spicer, marking the ones he does not like with a big arrow in black Sharpie â€” though he almost always makes time to monitor Mr. Spicer\\'s performance at the daily briefings, summoning him to offer praise or criticism, a West Wing aide said. Visitors to the Oval Office say Mr. Trump is obsessed with the dÃ©cor â€” it is both a totem of a victory that validates him as a serious person and an backdrop â€” so he has told his staff to schedule as many televised events in the room as possible. To pass the time between meetings, Mr. Trump gives quick tours to visitors, highlighting little tweaks he has made after initially expecting he would have to pay for them himself. Flanking his desk are portraits of Presidents Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson. He will linger on the opulence of the newly hung golden drapes, which he told a recent visitor were once used by Franklin D. Roosevelt but in fact were patterned for Bill Clinton. For a man who sometimes has trouble concentrating on policy memos, Mr. Trump was delighted to page through a book that offered him 17 window covering options. Ultimately, this is very much the White House that Mr. Trump wanted to build. But while the world reckons with the effect he is having on the presidency, he is adjusting to the effect of the presidency on him. He is now a public employee. And the only boss Mr. Trump ever had in his life was his father, a developer the president still treats with deep reverence. With most of his belongings in New York, the only family picture on the shelf behind Mr. Trump\\'s desk is a small photograph of that boss, Frederick Christ Trump.',\n",
              " 'Anyone inclined to find joy when a president\\'s taste collides with yours had a lot to choose from with Barack Obama. There was the time he dropped by the Los Angeles garage where the comedian Marc Maron records his podcast or when he sat between the two ferns where Zach Galifianakis pretends to be a boob hosting a talk show. At the 2015 White House Correspondents\\' Association Dinner, he did a bit with Key as Luther, Mr. Obama\\'s fictional but legitimately irate \"anger translator\" from \"Key Peele. \" He called Kanye West a jackass, invited Miranda to the White House Poetry Jam to perform a song from \"Hamilton\" before \"Hamilton\" was even a thing, and, for two straight years, dropped thoroughly convincing Spotify playlists. That doesn\\'t even include the New York Review of Books conversation (in two parts!) between him and the novelist Marilynne Robinson. They talked about â€¦ about â€¦ well it\\'s just sobering and oracular, and you should read it. But of all the culture Barack Obama has been a part of, inspired, commented on or cultivated, of all the ways in which the culture seemed to evolve around â€” and unconsciously respond to â€” him, the thing that says so much about his unprecedented relationship to art and popular culture is actually, in the vast scheme of things, just a footnote. Which is to say it\\'s pretty small yet so illustrative of his sense of respect, professionalism and awe. It was the time he was emailed for a quote. The occasion was the 2015 Kennedy Center Honors. The inductees included Carole King, who sat in the balcony between her fellow inductee George Lucas and the first couple. And during Ms. King\\'s tribute, out came Aretha Franklin, who sat at a piano in a fur coat and sang \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,\" the classic Ms. King wrote, and Ms. Franklin released in 1967. Her appearance was pretty much expected. The shock was how powerfully good, at 73, Ms. Franklin sounded â€” so good that you worried ecstasy would send Ms. King toppling off the balcony, so good that Mr. Obama wiped tears from his eyes. For a critical profile of Ms. Franklin in The New Yorker, its editor, David Remnick, reached out to the president. As a critic, I feel a duty to point out that that\\'s an unusual move. Mr. Remnick is also, among other things, a critic. He knows Ms. Franklin\\'s worth as an American treasure and that it has no price. He\\'s more than equipped to sum her up. But he outsourced that job. To the president of the United States. And if you got to that section of that story and considered rolling your eyes (\"When I emailed President Obama about Aretha Franklin and that night â€¦ \") you immediately retreated when you read what Mr. Obama wrote in response. \"Nobody embodies more fully the connection between the spiritual, the blues, R. B. rock and roll â€” the way that hardship and sorrow were transformed into something full of beauty and vitality and hope,\" he wrote back, through his press secretary. \"American history wells up when Aretha sings. That\\'s why, when she sits down at a piano and sings \\'A Natural Woman,\\' she can move me to tears â€” the same way that Ray Charles\\'s version of \\'America the Beautiful\\' will always be in my view the most patriotic piece of music ever performed â€” because it captures the fullness of the American experience, the view from the bottom as well as the top, the good and the bad, and the possibility of synthesis, reconciliation, transcendence. \" Mr. Remnick wrote to him because he knew that Barack Obama would deliver. Mr. Remnick asked for two cents. The president gave him a dollar. Mr. Obama, for nearly all of his tenure, was fully aware of, interested in, and knowledgeable about popular culture, even as it grew impossible to take it all in. He tried: sports, movies, television, the internet, music, books. He was protean and catholic. He was thoughtful and cool and yet far from it. He was a version of America\\'s dad and the dad some kids wished theirs could be: fit for world leadership, fit for a sitcom. Lots of smart people are poring over Mr. Obama\\'s record to divine a legacy. Which policies will last? How did he change the job? How did he distinguish himself? But this was a presidency whose few faint whiffs of scandal included being surreptitiously videoed last year by Usher dancing listlessly to Drake\\'s \"Hotline Bling,\" which was more than a year old. So to be fair: It\\'s an addictive song, and he moved like someone who had been dancing to it since it came out. In other words, Mr. Obama\\'s place in popular culture has always felt new, alive and mostly underappreciated. Obviously, other presidents have had a relationship with American culture. Television was in its creative infancy when Dwight D. Eisenhower entered office in 1953, and he took quick advantage of the power of its immediacy. When John F. Kennedy turned 45, he received American history\\'s most famous \"Happy Birthday\" from Marilyn Monroe. But it was tragedy and a glamorous wife that ensured Kennedy\\'s legacy in popular culture. Richard Nixon disliked \"All in the Family\" and was an avid moviegoer, who according to Mark Feeney\\'s surprising book \"Nixon at the Movies,\" watched about 500 films during his presidency. Ronald Reagan was a Hollywood actor before he was a politician, and, as a candidate, Bill Clinton made a lot of sense on MTV and Arsenio Hall\\'s talk show. But has any president been as conversant in the art and popular culture of this country as Barack Obama? Who has been as committed to opening up the White House to the sorts of artists he has? Lunches with the novelists Zadie Smith, Barbara Kingsolver, Junot DÃ­az, Dave Eggers and Colson Whitehead. One lunch, actually. That was one lunch. Initiative summits that included Alicia Keys, Nicki Minaj, J. Cole, Ludacris, Rick Ross, Pusha T. Common and Chance the Rapper. (So many different rappers and RB singers have come through the White House in the last eight years that the BET Awards could sue for copyright infringement.) Last year, Barack and Michelle Obama hosted \"Jazz at the White House,\" which featured appearances by so many magnificent, important people that to type out all the names â€” Chick Corea, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Ms. Franklin, for openers â€” is to make a very fancy shopping list. Mr. Obama brought all kinds of art and culture into the White House, and he sought culture out. At the same time, how we experience that art and culture, changed as much as the culture itself. When he entered office, in 2009, Netflix was a service. Now it\\'s a major reason we no longer watch TV we scarf it down. But that disruption â€” from channels and networks to platforms and apps â€” also unleashed TV that looked more like America: more nonwhite characters, more women, more gays. He presided over an era in which television and movies grappled with the meaning and meaninglessness of race, whether to laugh at it or take it seriously or ignore it altogether, whether the idea of a postracial America was ever possible, as though electing a black man for eight years erases the traumas of 400. To that end, \"30 Rock\" was the great situation comedy â€” a workplace farce, on and loosely about NBC, that hit its stride in 2008 and ran until 2013. Not so secretly, it was about the insurmountable work of race and gender. Meanwhile, the American movie industry went all in on franchises and sequels while leaving art and humanity for TV. But the \"Fast and Furious\" movies did bounce off the assembly line. The series started in 2001, essentially died in 2003, and came roaring back to life at the start of Mr. Obama\\'s first term and is ludicrously yet thankfully on the verge of an eighth installment. The protagonists are car thieves turned action heroes, who are mostly black, Asian, Latina or racially ambiguous. These aren\\'t great movies. But they\\'re great, fun: serious and without too much (or any) . And they take an issue that Hollywood has always struggled with â€” what to do with all these talented, interesting people of color? â€” and laughs at it. What to do? It\\'s not that hard: Let \\'em drive. Mr. Obama had his priorities straight, of course. Pop culture and art aren\\'t aspects of American life that should dominate a presidency. They have little to do with the business of governance. But Mr. Obama has always seemed to understand the importance of culture as mirror, window, escape hatch and haven. The Obamas were catholic in their tastes not because they had to be, but because that\\'s what we should be: open. Their minds were open, their hearts were open, their arms were open â€” to the Willie Nelsons, the BeyoncÃ©s, the Junot DÃ­azes, to all kinds of excellence. One of the happiest cultural events I\\'ve ever watched was the Presidential Medal of Freedom ceremony in November. The honor went to 21 men and women, from Robert De Niro and Tom Hanks and Michael Jordan to Cicely Tyson and Diana Ross and Ellen DeGeneres. Bill and Melinda Gates were honored. So were Maya Lin and Robert Redford. Mr. Obama had good material for most of them â€” philanthropists, movies stars, architect, alike. And, as he so often does and gets nary enough credit for, he delivered it with perfectly timed drollery. (He could easily enjoy a second career as a comedian.) These people meant something to him. His joshing notwithstanding, a few of them appeared to mean everything. The knock on Mr. Obama was that he was dry and aloof. Perhaps but not always. He understood what laughter could do. He knew the power of songs. He knew the power of singers, even if the only person doing the singing was, at first, only him. In 2015, at the memorial service after the Charleston massacre, he takes a dramatic, deliberative pause before intoning the lyrics to \"Amazing Grace. \" He starts and the choir behind him rises, out of surprise. You can tell he\\'s not singing because he thinks his baritone sounds good. He\\'s singing because something\\'s come over him, the way it does me, the way it does lots of people. What appears to have come over him at that memorial is both a sincere holiness and a rare, powerfully particular recognition of the glory and tragic risk of being black and American: He had to sing. In that moment, that song was all he seemed to have. That\\'s not a sensation you go looking for. It finds you. Good historians tend to know the right moment to evaluate a president\\'s place. They wait until the office is behind him, for the right mix of distance and scholarship. In the meantime, Barack Obama\\'s performance as president â€” meaning the performance he gave in the role of president of the United States â€” was flawless. Culturally speaking, he didn\\'t use his office to lift up, enlighten and entertain so much as share it. He wrote to David Remnick that he loved Ray Charles\\'s version of \"America the Beautiful\" because \"it captures the fullness of the American experience, the view from the bottom as well as the top, the good and the bad, and the possibility of synthesis, reconciliation, transcendence. \" The man knows his country and his Ray. But it\\'s entirely possible to read that quote and catch a chill because Mr. Obama could easily have been writing about himself.',\n",
              " 'HAZLETON, Pa. â€” Thousands of Dominicans have poured into this little city in eastern Pennsylvania since 2001 to work in the food plants and warehouses on the edge of town, where the highway to New York meets the highway to Philadelphia. Hazleton\\'s population is growing for the first time in more than half a century. Landlords, doctors and shopkeepers are learning to love their new customers. But the city\\'s economic evolution has left behind its previous, working class, and the presidential election has crystallized its frustrations. Many of those losing ground economically, including lifelong Democrats, say they plan to vote for Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee. Many of those who are prospering, including lifelong Republicans, say they will vote for the Democrat, Hillary Clinton. For both sides, how to deal with immigration has become a defining political issue, one that is likely to transcend the contretemps over Mr. Trump\\'s treatment of women that has cost him so much support among elected Republicans. This city was built by European immigrants who flocked here a century ago to work in the coal mines. Their children found better jobs in the factories. Now their grandchildren are struggling against economic decline and cultural displacement. \"I don\\'t care for this town no more because of the Hispanics,\" said Lewis Beishline, 70, as he sat drinking at 11 a. m. on a Friday at Cusat\\'s Cafe, a bar owned by the mayor of Hazleton, who lives upstairs. Mr. Beishline, a retired welder, said he moved from Hazleton to a nearby town last year because he no longer felt safe. He plans to vote for Mr. Trump, he said, \"because of the immigration. \" The Hispanic community, meanwhile, is eager to establish its own political power in the face of what many describe as persistent and painful discrimination. Community leaders in this city of 25, 000 say they have registered more than 800 Hispanic voters in recent months, expanding the voting rolls by almost 10 percent. \"I tell my kids, if someone asks where you are from, you say \\'Hazleton,\\'\" said Guillermo Lara, 49, who moved here from Mexico in the early 1990s and whose two daughters were born here. \"We\\'re here, and we don\\'t go nowhere. We want more. \" That sharp divide is mirrored by the candidates seeking the Oval Office. Beyond his promised wall and deportations, Mr. Trump has denigrated immigrants repeatedly, at times without distinguishing between legal and illegal immigration. \"Donald Trump\\'s position on illegal immigration plays a big role in his support not only in Hazleton but in northeast Pennsylvania,\" said Lou Barletta, a Republican who represents the region in Congress and has stood by his nominee as other Republicans in Congress have fled. In 2006, as Hazleton\\'s mayor, Mr. Barletta championed a ordinance penalizing employers and landlords for dealing with illegal immigrants. The courts blocked it from taking effect, but Mr. Barletta said Mr. Trump\\'s popularity reflected the continued demand for stronger government action. \"He\\'s going to win here, and win big,\" Mr. Barletta said. Mr. Barletta introduced Mr. Trump at a rally in nearby on Monday night, declaring that voters in northeastern Pennsylvania would propel Mr. Trump to the White House. Mrs. Clinton, by contrast, has celebrated immigrants, both legal and illegal, as important contributors to American society. Her campaign describes her plan to create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants as one of her most important ideas for increasing economic growth. \"Comprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy and keep families together â€” and it\\'s the right thing to do,\" Mrs. Clinton said in accepting the party\\'s presidential nomination in Philadelphia, about 100 miles southeast of Hazleton. The Hispanic population grew faster in Luzerne County, which includes Hazleton, than almost any other county between 2000 and 2011, according to the Pew Research Center. While immigration has slowed since the 2008 recession, Hispanics continue to move here from larger cities like New York and Paterson, N. J. In the 2000 census, just 4. 9 percent of Hazleton\\'s population identified as Hispanic. A decade later, that figure was 37 percent. By 2014, the most recent data available, 46 percent of the population said it was Hispanic. In all likelihood, Hazleton is now a city, just like the nearby cities of Reading and Allentown. The Hispanic ascendence emerged from seismic economic shifts, said Jamie Longazel, a professor of sociology at the University of Dayton who grew up just outside Hazleton and wrote a book, \"Undocumented Fears,\" about the city\\'s struggles with immigration. When the local coal mines began to close in the 1950s, Hazleton residents raised money to build an industrial park that attracted factories to the region. When the factories began to leave in the 1990s, the city mobilized again. Local officials won state permission to create one of Pennsylvania\\'s largest Keystone Opportunity Zones. A Cargill meat processing and distribution plant arrived in 2001. Other distribution businesses have followed, including an Amazon. com warehouse. Many residents claim that city officials advertised for immigrant labor on billboards in New York or New Jersey, but Mr. Longazel said there was no evidence that ever happened. The truth is that the immigration was unanticipated but most likely inevitable. \"The new jobs don\\'t pay as much as the old jobs did, and the reality is that folks were just not interested,\" Mr. Longazel said. The city also was also aging. Almost a quarter of the population was over 65 in 2000, roughly twice the national average. And nature abhors a vacuum â€” especially in a work force. Many of the new arrivals trace their roots to one Dominican city, San JosÃ© de Ocoa. Hazleton\\'s old shopping streets, nearly abandoned in the 1990s, are now lined with Dominican bakeries, barbershops, travel agencies and Mexican restaurants. The Italian restaurants are now run by Mexican families. The city has two Spanish radio stations and a television station that broadcasts six hours of local programming a day. Stephen M. Schleicher, a dermatologist, said Hispanic residents now made up a third of his patients. He has hired a bilingual receptionist and is looking for a bilingual nurse. He has started placing ads in the local newspaper. Dr. Schleicher, a lifelong Republican, said that Mr. Trump\\'s views on immigration had persuaded him, albeit reluctantly, to vote for Mrs. Clinton. \"We\\'re seeing a total revitalization despite the government trying to keep the immigrants out,\" he said. \"It would have been a ghost town of older white people. \" Yet it is easy to overstate Hazleton\\'s recovery. Many of the new jobs pay poorly. Almost 29 percent of the population lived in poverty in 2014, almost twice the national average. And Hazleton\\'s evolution has inspired deep resentment. Many residents complain bitterly about the new arrivals not speaking English, about loud music late at night, about people walking in the street and driving without regard for traffic rules. Wana Bostic, 45, scrapes by on $11. 50 an hour as a home health aide. She said that she was not paid nearly enough, but that employers can squeeze workers because of the ready availability of immigrant labor. \"No one talks about white Americans and what we really need,\" she said. Crime has increased, as has drug use. The police force, meanwhile, has shrunk with declining tax revenue. Many residents are convinced that illegal immigration is to blame. \"If you come into the country breaking the law, that\\'s not a good way to get your foot in the door,\" said Nick Zapotocky, 31, who now has three deadbolt locks on the door of his home. \"That says you\\'re willing to break the law again. \" He voted for President Obama in 2008. In 2012, he did not vote. And this year, he said he will vote for Mr. Trump. Francisco said people were blinded by their fear of change, unable to see the benefits that immigration is bringing to Hazleton. Mr. whose father was Mexican, runs a company that makes caps for old wells. He employs 30 people in the summer, only a few of them Hispanic. And he noted that some of the largest employers in the area are now Mexican companies, including Bimbo Bakeries, which has a plant nearby that makes millions of Thomas\\' English Muffins. Mr. said he had always voted Republican, loyal to his pocketbook. But he plans to vote for Mrs. Clinton, he said. \"They fear they\\'re losing what they remember,\" he said. \"But what can you do? The United States is in evolution. Apple pie came after the Germans arrived. Maybe it will now be \\'As American as salsa.\\' So what?\" Hazleton still has no Hispanic elected officials. The city just added its first Hispanic police officer. The public school system, which has very few Hispanic teachers, was ordered by the federal Department of Education in 2014 to improve efforts to teach English to immigrants, and to communicate with parents. But a second generation of Hispanic Americans in Hazleton may force change. Mr. Lara worked three jobs to pay private school tuition so his daughters could avoid Hazleton\\'s high school. After days in a factory, he washed dishes at night and cleaned offices on weekends. Two years ago, his eldest daughter, Amanda, graduated from Ithaca College in upstate New York with a degree in psychology and came home. She teaches classes for Hispanic children in the building that was once her elementary school. It has become a community center thanks in large part to Joe Maddon, a Hazleton native who manages the Chicago Cubs. Ms. Lara, who is studying for a master\\'s degree at the University of Scranton, said racial tensions had increased. At the city\\'s annual Funfest, she noticed an empty space between the Hispanic vendors and the Polish and Italian vendors. \"And I hear it from my kids,\" she said of her students. \"They\\'re not dumb. They can tell when they\\'re not liked or they\\'re not welcome. \" But she said she was not sure she wanted to move away. \"People say, \\'Why would you want to stay there? \\'\" she said. \"Well, for one thing, this is my hometown. \"',\n",
              " 'It was the Spring of 1979. I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school with buck-teeth and freckles. Each day in the cafeteria, I walked from table to table ... Stealing other kids\\' lunch money. No, I didn\\'t rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made them a little deal. \"Let me borrow two dollars today,\" I said, \"and I\\'ll bring you five dollars next week.\" The investment was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes. Of course when \"next week\" rolled around and I couldn\\'t pony up the cash, I promised to pay them even more the week after that, if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer. Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties, and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year\\'s lunch money. I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid, and I didn\\'t even get beat up. Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn. First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You\\'re not going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when you\\'re ahead. Don\\'t wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket. Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind. They are looking out for their own money, not yours. The \"professionals\", those stuffy investment counselors and money managers, will always tell you that the best time to buy is NOW. According to those guys, the longer you keep your money in the market, the more money you\\'re going to make. Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is \"NEVER\". In a sense, they are right. If you put $250,000 in an index fund right now, you\\'ll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years. But here\\'s the problem: Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich? Hell no! You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It\\'s hard to make use of your fortune when you\\'re seventy years old in a wheelchair. If you could make a million dollars in the next few years, what would you do with it? Where would you travel? What kind of car would you buy? The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich. If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility is your ally, and stability your enemy. You want to see those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed by the four hundred point crash a week later. You don\\'t care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long it was UNSTABLE. That\\'s how you\\'re going to make the money. What I\\'m talking about here is day trading. My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years he makes money. The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a $25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade. He acts quickly, taking advantage of all the information at his disposal about a certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or down within hours, sometimes within minutes. I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing amounts of money at it. It\\'s not rocket science, and you only need to learn a few basic principles to get started. Society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training. The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment strategies to make money. Popular media and investment professionals portray successful trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing ring. They don\\'t want the competetion - and they sure as hell don\\'t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm to execute a trade for which they\\'d charge you forty or fifty dollars. They make their money only if you believe two lies: 1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average person. 2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks per trade. Here is what the financial gurus in today\\'s society absolutely, positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ... The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend a few hours of studying. After reading over 200 financial books and publications during the past decade, and after using day trading to successfully make more than four million dollars in the stock market, I\\'ve learned the following lessons: ** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple. ** Anyone can do it. ** It only takes a few hours to learn. When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn\\'t become wealthy overnight. If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through hard work, knowledge, and determination. After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks brought modest gains. The next few months gave me the practical experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk, I had made my first million. The knowledge that I gained during those formative trading years I am willing to share with you in my new book, the Master Trader. You will learn from my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple, secret formula for day trading that I\\'ve used profitably year after year. The income of the day trader can be staggering. Thousands, even hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within minutes.

              " 'The F. B. I. had a job offer for Nick Young, a veteran Washington transit officer: Become an undercover informant for the bureau and gather information at local mosques on fellow Muslims who might pose a terrorism threat. The clandestine work would be \"a lot sexier\" than his current job, Mr. Young remembered an agent named Ryan telling him. And it could pay him a lot of money if the intelligence was good. Mr. Young turned him down. But it would not be the last time he would see the F. B. I. agent. Last August, five years later, Mr. Young was summoned to the headquarters of the transit agency, Metro, where Ryan and other agents were waiting for him. \"You probably don\\'t recognize me, do you?\" Ryan, whose beard was now thicker, asked him. \"Oh, I recognize you,\" Mr. Young said. This time, the agent handcuffed Mr. Young on a charge of supporting the Islamic State â€” a case built, in a twist, by an informant who posed as a terrorist fighter. The prosecution of Mr. Young, the only law enforcement officer among more than 100 Americans who have been accused of helping the Islamic State, offers a revealing look at the F. B. I. \\'s shadowy efforts to identify possible Islamic extremists. President Trump has vowed to intensify the effort as part of a campaign to \"annihilate\" the militant group. Mr. Young\\'s case also poses a challenge to the F. B. I. \\'s expanding use of undercover operations to identify Islamic State sympathizers inside the United States who might travel overseas to help the terrorist group or commit \"lone wolf\" attacks at home. His lawyer claims that the F. B. I. entrapped him, with undercover operatives popping in and out of his life for at least six years. To law enforcement officials, however, Mr. Young represents one of their worst fears: a longtime officer, with access to sensitive facilities, who they suspect was \"radicalized\" to support Islamic extremism. He is charged with providing \"material support\" to the Islamic State, in the form of $245 worth of Google Play gift cards. The authorities say he gave the gift cards to a Muslim friend named Mo â€” in reality, an undercover informant â€” to support recruitment for the terrorist group. Before now, very few American suspects linked to the Islamic State have spoken out. But in three and a half hours of interviews from jail, Mr. Young, a convert to Islam, portrayed himself and many other American Muslims under investigation as victims of religious persecution. He accused an \"overzealous\" F. B. I. of \"manufacturing\" the case. \"I know for sure I wouldn\\'t have been targeted if I was an evangelic Christian or a Sikh or a Hindu or something,\" said Mr. Young, 37. \"I\\'m not a terrorist,\" he added. \"Seeing these horrible allegations and the way they\\'re trying to paint me, it\\'s just a nightmare. \" Officials at the F. B. I. and the Justice Department declined to comment on the case. In general, the F. B. I. said in a statement, the investigative techniques used in such national security cases \"are subject to vigorous oversight and require us to use the least intrusive means possible. \" The F. B. I. has moved aggressively since the rise of the Islamic State in 2014 to identify suspected extremist supporters inside the United States, opening hundreds of investigations and generating convictions from Brooklyn to Southern California, often against young Muslim men. Mr. Trump has declared that the country must do more to confront what he calls \"radical Islamic terrorism,\" including the possibility of expanding surveillance and intelligence operations, creating a \"registry\" of American Muslims, and reviving torture as an interrogation technique. While Mr. Trump has sent mixed signals on some of those proposals, they have worried some civil liberties advocates, who say they are eager to see whether the Justice Department and the F. B. I. seek to expand their investigative powers still further in domestic terrorism cases. Mr. Young sees himself as a pawn in that broader fight. He acknowledges holding passionate views about the Middle East and the \"slaughter\" of Syrians by the government of President Bashar . On breaks from the transit agency, Mr. Young traveled to Libya twice in 2011 with body armor to join rebels fighting the Qaddafi regime. \"I didn\\'t kill anyone while I was there,\" he said, laughing, but \"I got shot at a lot. \" He insisted that he had never supported terrorists. He plans to take the witness stand at his trial, an unusual tactic for a terrorism suspect. \"Nick doesn\\'t have anything to hide,\" said Nicholas D. Smith, one of his lawyers. As he waits for his trial date, he sits in a rural jail in Warsaw, Va. reading science fiction occasionally, with \"The Jerry Springer Show\" sometimes playing on a television in the background. \"My brain\\'s turning to mush,\" he said. He said the jail had denied him access to Muslim prayer sessions. But the conditions are far better, he added, than the solitary confinement he was placed in for 23 hours a day for months after his arrest. That ordeal, he said, has caused lingering panic attacks and other problems. Unlike the bulk of the Americans charged with supporting the Islamic State, Mr. Young is not accused of plotting violence or trying to travel to the Middle East to fight with the group. He said he was under investigation for so long, it was almost inevitable that the authorities would find a way to charge him. \"At the end of the day, the crime I\\'m being accused of â€” a crime of sending gift cards â€” it would be laughable if it wasn\\'t really happening,\" Mr. Young said. He declined to explain the gift cards, citing a pretrial order that restricts what he can say about documents in the case. But he said his explanation would come out at his trial. Since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, dozens of terrorism defendants caught in undercover stings have claimed in court that they were illegally entrapped into saying or doing incriminating things. None have succeeded. Judges have given the Justice Department wide latitude in using undercover stings in terrorism cases. \"You almost need a perfect case\" to prove entrapment, said Seamus Hughes, a terrorism expert at George Washington University\\'s Program on Extremism, \"and that\\'s difficult to find. \" Still, several legal analysts said Mr. Young might have a legitimate shot, because of the unusual elements of the F. B. I. \\'s yearslong undercover investigation. They point out that even an charge that Mr. Young faces is based on his statements to agents about a fictional F. B. I. investigation into the whereabouts of a Islamic State fighter who never existed. Mr. Young apparently first came onto the F. B. I. \\'s radar around 2010 because he knew a fellow student at George Mason University, Zachary A. Chesser, who, like him, was a white convert to Islam from Northern Virginia and attended the same mosque. The F. B. I. interviewed Mr. Young that year as part of an investigation into Mr. Chesser, who ultimately pleaded guilty to charges after he was accused of threatening the creators of \"South Park\" over the show\\'s depiction of the Prophet Muhammad. Mr. Young does not appear to have been an F. B. I. target at the time, even as undercover informants began giving the bureau reports about the activities of him and some of his associates. He continued working as an armed officer patrolling subways and bus lines. He said F. B. I. agents â€” Ryan and a second agent â€” had met with him twice in 2011 to recruit him as an informant. Mr. Young said he found the idea of becoming an informant distasteful. The F. B. I. said in a court affidavit that he had used stronger language in a conversation with one of the bureau\\'s undercover informants, saying that if he were ever betrayed by one, \"that person\\'s head would be in a cinder block\" at the bottom of a lake. Based on wiretaps and statements from informants, the F. B. I. reported that Mr. Young had made a number of other incendiary and perhaps even threatening comments over the years about Muslim informants, F. B. I. investigators and \"kaffirs\" â€” or nonbelievers. Mr. Young acknowledged that he could have used \"a little \" in some of his private remarks. But he said he had never meant them to be taken literally. \"Everyone\\'s capable of saying stupid, blustery things,\" said Mr. Smith, his lawyer. Some F. B. I. officials pressed to bring criminal charges against Mr. Young years ago, but the Justice Department rebuffed them because of an apparent lack of evidence that he was involved in supporting terrorism, according to law enforcement officials. It was not until 2014 that Mr. Young crossed the line into supporting terrorism, the Justice Department now alleges. That was when he first met Mo, a Middle Easterner who said he was a military reservist, at a mosque where he prayed. Mr. Young said he had suspected early on that Mo might be an informant because of his strange mannerisms. But his concerns eased, and the two became friends, meeting at a Starbucks or elsewhere. Mo later told Mr. Young that he was thinking of traveling to Syria to join the Islamic State, prosecutors said. While Mr. Young sometimes appeared to offer Mo advice on how best to avoid government scrutiny if he went to the Middle East, he also told him at times that he did not need to join the terrorist group â€” at least not then, according to the F. B. I. \\'s account. \"There is no one with a gun to your head that is counting down,\" he told Mo in a conversation recorded in October 2014. Such statements, said Mr. Smith, his lawyer, show that \"the government is really grasping at straws here. \" Prosecutors are acting on \"really more of a hunch that he might commit crimes in the future,\" he said, \"and they can\\'t prove it. \"',\n",
              " 'Donald Trump\\'s looming nomination has spurred some leaders of the conservative movement â€” for generations, the backbone of the GOP â€” to break free from a Republican Party now being rapidly reshaped by the New York billionaire\\'s incendiary tone and unorthodox populism. The extraordinary resistance of many figures on the right this past week to Trump has not been prompted merely by objections to his temperament and fears about his electability in November. At the core has been a calculation by self-identified \"movement conservatives\" that they would rather preserve their entrenched ideological project than promote a nominee who they believe would violate their creed and ethos. [Video: The 10 Republicans who hate Donald Trump the most ] \"It\\'s a crisis,\" said Al Cardenas, a former chairman of the American Conservative Union who is withholding support for Trump. \"If we do away with the fundamental strength of the conservative movement, which is our ideas and values and principles, then you don\\'t have anything left but politics. A movement can survive the loss of an election cycle, but it can\\'t survive the loss of its purpose, and that\\'s what we\\'re battling here.\" The moment potentially marks the closure of a historic half-century in Republican politics in which conservatives have accrued dominant influence â€” on Capitol Hill, in gubernatorial mansions, at think tanks, on talk radio and in the grass roots. Since Barry Goldwater\\'s unsuccessful but edifying 1964 presidential run, the conservative movement has been at the crux of Republican campaigns, from Ronald Reagan\\'s 1980 sweep to the 1994 revolution to the tea party\\'s rise in 2010. Yet, by taking a stand they see as a stroke of moral clarity, conservative leaders are at risk of separating their coalition from a Republican Party in which voters coast to coast have effectively shifted the center of gravity by choosing Trump as their standard bearer. In the primaries, Trump defeated a string of classically conservative candidates by peeling away many of the movement\\'s core supporters: evangelical and working-class white voters. There is talk in various quarters about a potential independent challenge to Trump and likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, though there is no consensus candidate, and a third-party bid would be exceedingly difficult for anyone to mount at this late stage. Freshman Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) is a vocal proponent, but he is not offering himself as a candidate. Bill Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard, is involved in discussions to draft an independent conservative and huddled last week with Mitt Romney, though the former Massachusetts governor repeatedly has ruled out another White House bid. Erick Erickson, a prominent conservative commentator, is among those urging a third-party candidate. \"One of the silver linings that can come from this is that the conservative movement as an entity pulls back away from the Republican Party,\" Erickson said. \"During the Bush administration, it became a subsidiary of the Republican Party. This gives us a good opportunity as conservatives to stand on our own two feet.\" The conservative resistance was expressed most prominently last week by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, the country\\'s top-ranking elected Republican, who announced that he could not support Trump until the business mogul demonstrated his conservative bona fides and offered a more inclusive vision. Trump snapped back with a retort that neatly underscored his belief that movement conservatives should no longer dictate the GOP mission and platform: \"I am not ready to support Speaker Ryan\\'s agenda.\" \"If there\\'s an ideological leader of our party right now, it\\'s Paul Ryan,\" said former senator Judd Gregg (R-N.H.). \"He\\'s not part of the shouting crowd; he\\'s part of the doing crowd. But the party\\'s voters have gone with the shouting crowd. It\\'s reflective of the failure of the doer crowd to get things done.\" [Ryan says he is \\'not ready\\' to back Trump, deepening GOP divide] Indeed, Trump and Ryan are miles apart. Ryan is the architect of sweeping proposed changes to Medicare and Social Security; Trump has pledged not to touch either. Ryan supports a muscular foreign policy; Trump is proudly non-interventionist. Ryan champions free trade; Trump is an avowed opponent. Ryan defends religious freedom; Trump wants to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country. Ryan advocates bipartisan immigration reform and opposes mass deportation; Trump wants to build a wall at the Mexican border and deport the roughly 11 million immigrants who are living in the United States illegally. Ryan and his conservative allies in elected offices nationwide still have a firm grip on the party\\'s governing playbook and institutions. But Trump has forced a heated debate over Republican identity and whether it is synonymous with conservatism â€” a threat to the authority of movement conservatives. \"The Ryan agenda isn\\'t just about Paul Ryan, but it\\'s what conservatives have agreed on as the best way forward â€” and Trump is deviating from that in so many ways,\" said Lanhee Chen, a fellow at Stanford University\\'s Hoover Institution who served as Romney\\'s policy director during his 2012 presidential bid. \"The big question really is, to what extent is the Trump phenomenon an aberration in policy versus some more fundamental shift?\" Chen asked. \"I tend to think of it as an aberration.\" Republican National Chairman Reince Priebus has sought to broker an accord between Trump and Ryan with a planned meeting Thursday in Washington, but Trump\\'s public comments suggest that changes by him are unlikely. Trump has said he would meet with Ryan, \"before we go our separate ways.\" [Trump agrees to meet with Paul Ryan \\'before we go our separate ways\\'] Some conservative movement figures have warmed to Trump, expressing confidence that he would surround himself with advisers of their ilk â€” such as Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who has become a trusted confidant of the candidate\\'s â€” and that, if Trump is elected, Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) would serve as checks on his power. \"The deals he\\'s going to cut will have in the room Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, and the three of them have to agree. I sleep well at night,\" said Grover Norquist, president and founder of Americans for Tax Reform, who for decades has convened conservative leaders and activists. A group of House Republicans, including several top leadership supporters, have wondered whether Ryan and other conservative leaders have fully recognized what they see as a striking shift in the electorate. A pair of committee chairmen â€” Reps. Bill Shuster (Pa.) and Jeff Miller (Fla.) â€” endorsed Trump shortly before he became the presumptive nominee. \"It\\'s not the time to be out there demanding all of these things, trying to get Trump to suddenly become Reagan,\" said William J. Bennett, a Ryan mentor and prominent conservative commentator. \"Now is the time to surround him with good people and work with him at the convention.\" Norquist, who attended and praised Trump\\'s foreign-policy address last month, said he sees limits to Trump\\'s long-term influence on conservatism. \"You\\'re not picking a direction for the modern Republican Party or the conservative movement with one presidential candidate,\" he said. \"There isn\\'t some Trump wing of the party. What is Trumpism? You don\\'t see senators and governors running under Trumpism. There\\'s just Trump.\" [Trump\\'s apostasies put him at odds with decades of Republican beliefs] Especially anxious about Trump\\'s success are conservatives who prioritize social issues and fear he would weaken the party\\'s moral tilt. Though Trump says he is against abortion and same-sex marriage, the New Yorker rarely talks about those issues â€” and until only a few years ago, he held opposite positions. \"I haven\\'t heard him frame things in moral terms,\" Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) said. \"I don\\'t hear him speak about the Constitution. It\\'s hard to believe he has any sort of deep conviction on life and marriage. I don\\'t see him being guided by constitutional principles. He doesn\\'t speak about them, ever. That\\'s what\\'s troubling everyone. He\\'s not even speaking in the same language, politically, that we speak.\" King, who had supported Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and has no plans to endorse Trump, said he and other conservative leaders would \"keep watch\" at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland to protect the party\\'s platform from being revamped. \"We run the risk of the underpinnings of our convictions being disregarded,\" King said. Numerous Republicans fret that this divide could lead to certain electoral defeat for the party, up and down the ticket. Those like Gregg â€” a fiscal conservative who backed former Florida governor Jeb Bush and then Ohio Gov. John Kasich in the primaries and said he is in the \"listening\" phase of considering Trump â€” see hope for a coming together by finding areas of consensus. \"At the center of Republican philosophy is market economy and fiscal responsibility, and Trump is very much in tune,\" Gregg said. \"I expect in the end that\\'s what will draw people into a unified effort.\"',\n",
              " 'MELBOURNE, Australia â€” The sibling rivalry, at least on the tennis tour, started right here at the Australian Open for the Williams sisters. It was 1998, and older sister Venus beat younger sister Serena, (4) in a match that â€” as intrusive as it felt to watch â€” surely drew more attention than any match in history between a pair of Australian Open debutantes. The fascination in their dynamic and their futures was there from the start in Melbourne Park, known then as Flinders Park when it had only one stadium with a retractable roof instead of three. A picture of Venus consoling Serena after the match was on the front page of The New York Times. Though it would be tempting to label their Australian Open final on Saturday as a moment and to speculate that it might be their last meeting at this late a stage of a Grand Slam tournament, it seems best to resist the temptation. The Williams sisters have taught us a lot about the limits of conventional tennis wisdom through the years. And so, even if 19 years have passed and Serena is now 35 and Venus 36, it is wise to avoid fencing them in again after they have run roughshod over so many other preconceptions. \"I watched Venus today celebrating after she won the semifinal like she was a girl, and it made you want to cry for joy just watching her,\" said Marion Bartoli, a former Wimbledon champion. \"Such a powerful image, and it makes you think about all those questions she was getting: \\'When are you retiring? Have you thought about retiring? How much longer?\\' \"You must let the champions decide when the right moment comes. \" The Williamses are both great champions, even if Serena is clearly the greater player with her 22 Grand Slam singles titles and her long run at No. 1, a spot she can reclaim from Angelique Kerber with a win Saturday. Serena has been the most prolific Grand Slam winner after age 30 in tennis history, and she is back in rare form again after another extended break at the end of 2016. She disconnected completely from the game and physical training initially and had to push hard to get back in shape in November and December. It worked. She has not dropped a set here despite a challenging draw, nor has she even been pushed to a tiebreaker. Newly engaged to the American technology entrepreneur Alexis Ohanian, who has watched her matches from the players box, and seemingly refreshed, Serena deserves to be the favorite to win her 23rd major singles title and break her tie with Steffi Graf for the highest total in the Open era. In this tournament, Serena has beaten two former members of the top 10 â€” Belinda Bencic and Lucie Safarova â€” and one current member, the No. 9 seed Johanna Konta. Venus\\'s draw has been soft by comparison, devoid of top 10 players â€” past or present â€” and including only one seeded player: No. 24 Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. On Thursday, she had to scrap and come back to win, (3) against the powerful unseeded American CoCo Vandeweghe, while Serena cruised past the unseeded Croat Mirjana . Serena, who already holds a edge over her sister, could be the fresher player, too, on Saturday. But the psychology remains complex and the fallout unpredictable, even after all these years. \"When I\\'m playing on the court with her, I think I\\'m playing the best competitor in the game,\" Venus said. \"I don\\'t think I\\'m chump change either, you know. I can compete against any odds. No matter what, I can get out there, and I compete. \" They have not played since the 2015 United States Open, when Serena won, in a quarterfinal in which Venus attacked, often successfully, from the start but had no answer in the end for Serena\\'s ultimate weapon: her first serve. It was an intense match in which the big crowd in Arthur Ashe Stadium seemed more reflective than fully engaged one in which Serena\\'s celebration was understandably subdued with her sister across the net, even if their matches are no longer the awkward, constricted affairs of their early years. Saturday\\'s final in Melbourne could be intriguing on multiple levels, in part because of the Australian public. Venus is viewed here, as elsewhere, as a sympathetic figure: the older sister who has handled the younger\\'s greater tennis success unselfishly and with dignity. And though both sisters have had to cope with major health problems and family tragedy, with the murder of their half sister Yetunde Price in 2003, Venus is the one whose tennis fortunes dipped more dramatically. A Grand Slam singles champion and a former No. 1, she did not advance past the third round in any major event in singles from late 2011 to the end of the 2014 season. She was a major star reduced to a minor role, largely because of an autoimmune disorder â€” Sjogren\\'s syndrome, diagnosed in 2011 â€” that sapped her strength and endurance. When Russian hackers breached the World Agency\\'s databases last fall, it was revealed that Venus had needed 13 exemptions for drugs in recent years. The retirement questions to which Bartoli referred started during that period. But Venus\\'s ability to cope with her condition has improved, and after rejoining the top 10 in 2015, she reached the semifinals at Wimbledon last year and then the final here. \"She never even thought of the word retire,\" said David Witt, her coach and hitting partner of 10 years. \"I just think when she got diagnosed, it was a step back, a shock. She\\'s learned a lot about how to deal with it and her body, how to eat, how to manage it. \"There are days she can\\'t work as hard as she wants to work. Some days it\\'s maybe not smart to do it because it will then hurt you for two or three more days. Where she is now in her career, she has to listen to her body, and I don\\'t think she really needs to go out and hit balls for two hours. \" Witt said there were no more sessions in the or in time off tour: just one session in the morning and then gym work, primarily sprints, core strengthening and flexibility. \"It took her years and years to realize that stretching is important and can keep you healthier,\" he said. \"The more flexible you are, you\\'re not going to strain or pull anything. I\\'ve been with her 10 years, and I think it took seven years to get her to stretch. She likes to do a lot of dancing, and that consists of a lot of stretching and being flexible, so I think that\\'s helped. \" Her dance skills were in evidence Thursday as she pirouetted after beating Vandeweghe, but what will linger longest in memory were her screams of delight at having conquered an inspired young opponent in a semifinal. It was a moment she described as \"just joy. \" \"You could really see the happiness on her face,\" Serena said. \"I\\'ve been there when she was down and out of it, and back and in it. I\\'ve been there for all those moments, so I just really was oh so happy. \" As visceral as her reaction on court was, she was nothing but considered in the interview room. \"I think why people love sport so much is because you see everything in a line,\" Venus said. \"In that moment, there is no . There\\'s no retake. There is no . It\\'s triumph and disaster witnessed in real time. \"This is why people live and die for sport, because you can\\'t fake it. You can\\'t. It\\'s either you do it or you don\\'t. People relate to the champion. They also relate to the person who didn\\'t win, because we all have those moments in our life. \" This will be Venus\\'s first major singles final since she lost to Serena in straight sets in the 2009 Wimbledon final, and her first match against Serena in Melbourne since the 2003 final when Serena won her fourth Grand Slam title in a row, having defeated Venus in all four finals. \"It\\'s just amazing,\" said Rennae Stubbs, the Australian star who first met the sisters before they joined the tour. \"They came onto the scene at age 15 and 16 with the beads and the hair and the exuberance, and here they are: mature, remarkable young women at 35 and 36. No matter what anyone says to me, their story from start to finish is the greatest sports story ever. \" And if the Williamses have taught us anything along the way, it is that the story is not finished until they say it is.',\n",
              " 'In her standard stump speech, Hillary Rodham Clinton talks about fighting income inequality, celebrating court rulings on gay marriage and health care, and, since the Emanuel AME Church massacre, toughening the nation\\'s gun laws. That last component marks an important evolution in presidential politics. For at least the past several decades, Democrats seeking national office have often been timid on the issue of guns for fear of alienating firearms owners. In 2008, after Barack Obama took heat for his gaffe about people who \"cling to guns or religion,\" he rarely mentioned guns again â€” neither that year nor in his 2012 reelection campaign. But in a sign that the political environment on guns has shifted in the wake of recent mass shootings â€” and of Clinton\\'s determination to stake out liberal ground in her primary race against insurgent Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) â€” Clinton is not only initiating a debate about gun control but also vowing to fight the National Rifle Association. \"I\\'m going to speak out against the uncontrollable use of guns in our country because I believe we can do better,\" Clinton said Tuesday in Iowa City. A few days earlier, she said in Hanover, N.H.: \"We have to take on the gun lobby. . . . This is a controversial issue. I am well aware of that. But I think it is the height of irresponsibility not to talk about it.\" Clinton\\'s comments could stoke millions of politically active gun owners, and Wayne LaPierre, the NRA\\'s executive vice president, argued that the move was fraught with peril for her. \"We\\'ve been down this road before with the Clintons,\" \\xadLa\\xadPierre said through a spokesman. \"She needs to read her husband\\'s book.\" In his memoir, \"My Life,\" former president Bill Clinton suggested that his vice president, Al Gore, lost the 2000 presidential election in part because of backlash in states such as Arkansas and Tennessee over the Clinton administration\\'s 1995 ban on assault weapons, which has since expired. Many Democratic lawmakers also lost their elections after gun-control votes. The Republican 2016 presidential candidates, in keeping with GOP orthodoxy, have spoken out loudly against gun control. Many gave speeches at the NRA\\'s spring convention and tout their high ratings from the group. Mark Glaze, a longtime gun-control advocate who until recently oversaw former New York mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\\'s gun-control efforts, argued that Hillary Clinton should embrace her husband\\'s record. \"The Clintons pulled off the almost-impossible by giving us the background-check system and banning assault weapons,\" Glaze said. \"That\\'s something President Obama wasn\\'t able to do. Their political interest lies in owning, rather than obscuring, that accomplishment.\" Many Democratic strategists said campaigning on guns is smart politics for Hillary Clinton both in the primary and, should she become the nominee, in the general election. Gun control is one of the few issues on which Clinton has a more left-leaning record than Sanders, who represents a rural, pro-gun-rights state and has voted in the past for legislation to protect the firearms industry. Although Clinton has not attacked Sanders by name, by invoking guns she makes an unspoken contrast. The issue also fits neatly into the overall narrative Clinton is trying to present. She can stake out a bold stance on an issue that plays well with the liberal base while arguing that she would break through the partisan stalemate in Washington. There are few issues more in\\xadtrac\\xadtable than guns. In 2013, after the massacre of 20 young children and six educators at an elementary school in \\xadNewtown, Conn., a bipartisan compromise to expand background checks for firearm purchases failed to pass the Senate despite overwhelming popular support and President Obama\\'s backing. Clinton began talking about gun control in the days following last month\\'s church shooting in Charleston, S.C., and aides said she plans to keep it in her stump speech, although she has no immediate plans to unveil a detailed gun policy. \"This is an important issue, and she believes that we cannot let partisan gridlock prevent us from continuing to seek \\xadcommon-sense safety measures,\" said Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon. Despite his mixed voting record, Sanders did support the 2013 background-check bill and \\xadassault-weapons ban. And on the stump, he is trying to sound more forceful. He notes that \"guns in Chicago and Los Angeles mean a very different thing than guns in Vermont and New Hampshire\" but says â€” as he did two weeks ago in Bow, N.H. â€” that the next president must \"come forward with a common-sense proposal on guns.\" In the Democratic field, former Maryland governor Martin O\\'Mal\\xadley has the strongest record in favor of gun control. He supported an assault-weapons ban as mayor of Baltimore in the early 2000s and then signed one into law as governor in 2013, along with a suite of gun restrictions that stand as among the nation\\'s toughest. \"He\\'s the only person in the race who\\'s led on this issue,\" said O\\'Malley spokeswoman Haley Morris. Looking to the general election, some gun-control measures are popular, especially with the coalition of swing-state Latinos, African Americans, and young and suburban women the Democratic nominee would need to win the White House. \"There is no more powerful force in an election than the suburban mother, and you don\\'t find a lot of suburban mothers that are against some sort of common-sense gun control,\" said Mo \\xadElleithee, a former Clinton adviser and Democratic strategist who now directs the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service. Other Democrats argue that Clinton has nothing to lose. Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (D-Va.) said the NRA has become a \"paper tiger,\" noting the elections he\\'s won despite the NRA\\'s vocal opposition. \"I think she has no illusion that even if she didn\\'t say a word about guns, the NRA would be out there blasting her to say she had a conspiratorial plan to work with the U.N. to take everybody\\'s guns away, so why not go head-on on an issue that will improve safety,\" Kaine said. A survey this year by the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research found that 89 percent favor requiring background checks for all gun sales, including 85 percent of gun owners. But polling is much more closely divided on other gun restrictions and does not account for the high intensity among gun-control opponents. David \"Mudcat\" Saunders, a Democratic strategist based in conservative rural Virginia, warned that Clinton\\'s focus on guns could taint the entire Democratic ticket, including candidates for state and local offices. \"Never in the history of the Democratic Party have they started a gun debate that didn\\'t cost them numbers in the general election,\" said Saunders, who supports the candidacy of former senator Jim Webb (D-Va.). \"She\\'s trying to get to the left of Bernie, obviously, but I think it\\'ll hurt her in the long run â€” and it\\'ll cost anybody on the down ticket in the South and in rural America.\" In her 2008 presidential campaign, Clinton stayed nearly silent on guns. An exception was after Obama\\'s \"cling to guns\" comment surfaced, when she attacked him as being \"elitist\" and fondly recalled her father teaching her to shoot as a little girl at her grandfather\\'s Pennsylvania lake house. Howard Wolfson, for many years a top Clinton aide before going to work for Bloomberg, said Clinton\\'s avoidance of guns in 2008 should not be mistaken for a lack of interest in gun control. \"I started working for her back in 1999 and she talked about it back then,\" Wolfson said. \"As a senator from New York, it was something that was important to her. I think in the wake of Newtown and Charleston, it\\'s more resonant in our political culture.\" In recent months, Clinton\\'s speechwriters and policy staff have sought counsel from Bloomberg\\'s group, Everytown for Gun Safety. Erika Soto Lamb, \\xadEverytown\\'s spokeswoman, said Clinton\\'s focus on the issue is \"striking.\" \"Knowing how hard we tried in 2012 to get [Republican nominee Mitt] Romney or Obama to say something about guns,\" she said, \"it is a changed world now when Hillary and other candidates are making it a part of their stump. This is the first presidential election when we\\'ve seen proactive statements.\" Jose DelReal in Iowa City and Scott Clement in Washington contributed to this report.',\n",

She has talked in very positive terms about both of our candidates and the substantive campaigns they\\'ve run . As for the stuff that Joe and Mika tried to rehash this morning about debates, the fact is our debates earned far better ratings overall this year than they did in past cycles. And as NBC knows all too well, when we were able to get both campaigns to agree, we added four. The rules in place for this election have been pretty much the same for several cycles. In fact, the major change from 2008 â€“ when Obama beat Clinton --- is that there are actually LESS unpledged \"super\" delegates, now down to 15% from 20% prior to the change. No one wrote or rewrote any rules to help or hurt any specific candidate, these are the Party rules. The single biggest factor determining the nominee (85%) is the participation of voters in primaries and caucuses. You can see a post we did here that lays out the facts on Super Delegates .

Did we get them the info near the bottom? Bernie Sanders faces a \\'then what\\' problem 05/19/16 08:53 AMâ€”UPDATED 05/19/16 08:55 AM facebook twitter 1 save share group 93 By Steve Benen It\\'s safe to say May hasn\\'t gone quite as well as Bernie Sanders and his supporters had hoped. He needed landslide victories in several primaries, and he came up short. After steadily gaining on Hillary Clinton in national Democratic polls for months, the senator has seen his support slip in recent weeks. In Nevada, Sanders\\' supporters caused a near-riot at the state Democratic convention, based on allegations of party wrongdoing that have struggled to withstand scrutiny . Sanders\\' candidacy has had some highs and some lows, but all things considered, this hasn\\'t exactly been a month to remember. For his legions of supporters, it\\'s no doubt discouraging. The race for the Democratic nomination, however, still has about a month to go, and the New York Times reports that Team Sanders isn\\'t backing down, delegate arithmetic notwithstanding. Defiant and determined to transform the Democratic Party, Senator Bernie Sanders is opening a two-month phase of his presidential campaign aimed at inflicting a heavy blow on Hillary Clinton in California and amassing enough leverage to advance his agenda at the convention in July â€“ or even wrest the nomination from her. It\\'s at this point when Sanders and campaign operation start to run into a \"then what?\" problem. According to the Times\\' piece, for example, Team Sanders believes it may yet win the California primary, where polls show him trailing, which might have \"a psychological impact\" on Democrats. OK, but then what? If the idea is that Democratic insiders will ignore the will of the voters and the delegate count because of one primary result, awarding Sanders the nomination despite his second-place finish, there\\'s no reason to believe such a scenario is plausible. The same article said Team Sanders is willing to hurt Clinton, on purpose, even as the general-election phase gets underway. OK, but then what? There\\'s still no reason to believe this will prompt party officials to override the primary and caucus results. A Sanders supporter told the Times, \"We want to have progressive values and socialism on the convention\\'s agenda.\" OK, but then what? It\\'s not clear how, exactly, one puts \"socialism\" on the \"agenda,\" but even if that were possible, what happens afterwards? Tad Devine, a top Sanders strategist, told the Washington Post\\'s Greg Sargent yesterday that the Sanders campaign may ask for some changes among convention committee assignments. OK, but then what? What are the practical effects of changing which Democrats sit on which convention committees, and why should a second-place candidate dictate convention committees\\' membership? There are rumors about Sanders supporters preparing for civil disobedience and organized disruptions at the Democratic convention itself. OK, but then what? History has shown that convention protests, even intra-party protests, can lead to meaningful change, but even if progressive activists literally started fires on the convention floor, in a display of violent catharsis, how does that bring Sanders and his allies any closer to their goals? The Times article added this key paragraph: [Sanders\\'] newly resolute attitude is also the cumulative result of months of anger at the national Democratic Party over a debate schedule that his campaign said favored Mrs. Clinton; a fund-raising arrangement between the party and the Clinton campaign; the appointment of fierce Clinton partisans as leaders of important convention committees; and the party\\'s rebuke of Mr. Sanders on Tuesday for not clearly condemning a melee at the Nevada Democratic convention on Saturday. It\\'s worth noting, however, that the national Democratic Party agreed to expand the debate schedule, and it offered Sanders literally the identical fundraising arrangement it struck with the Clinton campaign. Democratic officials also worked to make sure Sanders appeared on the New Hampshire and D.C. primary ballots, even after procedural and legal questions arose surrounding his eligibility â€“ steps the DNC wouldn\\'t have taken if it were trying to rig the process against him. There\\'s still time to avoid scenarios that could prove costly in the fall, but not a lot of time. Sanders believes, accurately, that he has some leverage: if he\\'s not satisfied with how the process unfolds in the coming weeks, the senator can sabotage the party\\'s ticket and elect President Trump. What\\'s less clear is what he\\'ll demand in exchange for his supp',\n",
              " 'Six years of war in Syria have ravaged the life of Ebrahim Abbas, 27. Mr. Abbas, a computer technician, was detained for protesting against the Syrian government, besieged in his hometown and shot in the stomach, and watched his brother die in a shelling attack. He escaped, but his father, a diabetic, died later from a lack of medicine, and his mother was killed by a sniper. It was from his refuge in Turkey that Mr. Abbas heard about President Trump\\'s decision to launch 59 cruise missiles at a Syrian air base to punish President Bashar for a chemical weapons attack. It felt good. \"Watching a world power taking revenge for civilians against the Syrian regime gave me a surge of hope and made me a bit optimistic,\" Mr. Abbas said. But the attack will not bring back all that he has lost nor help him return home soon. In a measure of how entrenched the war is, there were new airstrikes on Saturday on the town targeted in the attack, with at least one person killed, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The strike on the air base was the most direct, deliberate military intervention by the United States against Mr. Assad\\'s forces since the war began. Mr. Trump said he had launched the strike because he was moved by images of women and children choking on poison gas. \"That was a horrible, horrible thing,\" he told reporters after the chemical attack. \"And I\\'ve been watching it and seeing it, and it doesn\\'t get any worse than that. \" But while the strike on Thursday appeared intended to limit the chances of retaliation, Mr. Trump has offered no proposals to end the war or to assuage the vast human suffering it has generated, sending fleeing Syrians across the globe. Yasmine Mashaan, a pharmacy technician from the town of Muhassan in eastern Syria who lost several brothers to the conflict, said the strike was unlikely to change much for her and her family. And she doubts Mr. Trump\\'s motivations. \"It would be great if he continued this in the direction of saving more civilians or establishing a safe zone, but after his racist speeches and policy, I think the strike is more for popularity,\" said Ms. Mashaan, who is now in Germany after fleeing there with her family. \"But judging by how fast he intervened in Syria and how powerful it was, then we might be going somewhere with it. \" The number affected by the conflict boggles the mind. What began as an uprising in 2011 escalated into a civil war as protesters took up arms to respond to the government\\'s repression and seek its ouster. Over time, countries like the United States, Turkey and Saudi Arabia backed the rebels, while Russia and Iran helped Mr. Assad. As chaos spread, extremist groups gained ground. Al Qaeda infiltrated the rebel movement, while the jihadists of the Islamic State seized territory that extended into Iraq. Now more than 400, 000 people have been killed, a figure roughly equal to the population of Tulsa, Okla. or Oakland, Calif. Many more have been maimed. Half of Syria\\'s prewar population of 22 million have fled their homes, a number close to the population of Belgium. Five million of those are registered refugees abroad, according to the United Nations. Most are in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, where 70 percent live on less than $3. 84 a day, less than the cost of some lattes at Starbucks. Jan Egeland, the secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, which does aid work in Syria, said he could not comment for or against the strike by the United States, but he said that \"they do not solve any of my urgent priorities. \" For the humanitarian situation to improve, aid workers would need more border crossings for getting aid into the country, assurances that air and ground forces would not attack hospitals and better access to besieged and suffering communities, including nearly 400, 000 people within an hour\\'s drive of Damascus, the capital. \"It is heartbreakingly frustrating to be a humanitarian worker and to have the resources and the supplies but not to be able to reach these people,\" Mr. Egeland said. Within the conflict\\'s statistics are countless stories of torture, detention, forced conscription, families torn apart and normal lives downgraded rapidly or simply cut short. Even some Syrians who welcomed the strike questioned why, after all of the war\\'s brutality, it was the chemical attack this past week that had brought a show of force against Mr. Assad. \"Of course chemicals are weapons of mass destruction,\" said a doctor east of Damascus who treated victims of the first major chemical attack in Syria, in 2013. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared government reprisal. \"But what about sieges? What about killing children? Isn\\'t it wrong for children to grow up without knowing Tom and Jerry? Without knowing chocolate?\" President Barack Obama did not respond militarily to a chemical attack in 2013, despite having called the use of such weapons a \"red line. \" Since then, the doctor has watched the world move on while the siege of his area has tightened, he said through Skype. He said he had learned to live with less electricity, less fuel, less clean water and less food. \"We are living like ancient people, how they depended on themselves, how they used wood to make fires,\" he said. \"It is a hard life. \" He expected more from the United States and its allies after the 2013 attack, what he called \"a position that was appropriate for the free world. \" But the result was an agreement, brokered by Russia, for Mr. Assad to give up his chemical weapons. \"The solution to the crime was a deal to take away the weapon but leave the criminal,\" the doctor said. The strike by the United States made him mildly optimistic that Mr. Trump would intervene more forcefully than Mr. Obama had. \"Trump is a closed box that has started to open,\" he said. \"Soon we will see what\\'s inside. \" While conflict monitors said that Mr. Assad\\'s forces and their allies had caused the bulk of the war\\'s deaths with their advanced weapons, communities loyal to Mr. Assad have also paid a heavy price. Tens of thousands of Syrian soldiers have been killed, and religious minorities, secularists and others who view Mr. Assad as a symbol of a unified Syria have continued to fight out of fear that they would be eradicated if Islamist rebels take over the country. Others have had to face both the government and the jihadists. Ms. Mashaan, the pharmacy technician, said her family\\'s troubles began when she intervened to stop a security officer from beating her brother for protesting. The officer beat her instead, breaking her arm. As the uprising spread, Ms. Mashaan, 36, and her five brothers joined in. Soon, her brothers and husband were arrested and tortured, in some cases coming home with their fingernails removed, she said. Then they began to die. One was killed when security forces fired into a crowd of protesters, she said. Another was shot in their home by a sniper. Yet another disappeared. She later recognized his face in a trove of photos of bodies smuggled out of a prison near Damascus. As violence spread, Ms. Mashaan\\'s family fled to a refugee camp in the countryside, but it was soon taken over by a new force in the area: Islamic State jihadists. They killed her younger brother and took advantage of her medical training by forcing her to work in a clinic, she said. The family later fled to a refugee camp across the border in Turkey, where they lived until Ms. Mashaan\\'s husband and her last remaining brother joined the migration to Europe and paid smugglers to take them to Greece in rubber dinghies. They made their way to Germany, where she and her five children joined them last year. Living in Germany is hard, she said in a Facebook chat from her new home. Not speaking the language made it difficult to register the children, and many Germans refused to rent lodgings to her family because they were refugees, she said.',\n",
              " 'May 7th is likely going to be a day of clashes against protesters who are coming from all over the United States to demonstrate against the removal of Confederate monuments in New Orleans. Homeland Security and New Orleans Police Superintendent Michael Harrison have promised that they will be arresting anyone who commits or threatens to commit an act of violence. The three locations they ll be watching are: Lee Circle, Congo Square and the Jefferson Davis monument, as credible threats have been reportedTension in New Orleans has mounted since the Battle of Liberty Place obelisk was removed early on the morning of April 24, part of an initiative by Mayor Mitch Landrieu, backed by the City Council, to rid New Orleans of what some consider to be tributes to racism. Supporters consider the monuments part of history, and their removal an attempt to erase history.Protestors on both sides clashed at the Jefferson Davis statute this week, prompting police to barricade the monument. Barricades also appeared Friday afternoon at Lee Circle.Landrieu has said statues of Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and P.G.T. Beauregard and Confederacy President Jefferson Davis will come down sometime after the 2017 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival wraps ends Sunday.RADICAL activists like Take Em Down Nola, a group that has long advocated for the monuments removal, plans to rally at Congo Square on Sunday at 1:30 p.m then march to Lee Circle. At least one pro-monument contingent has called for a rally at 11 a.m. at Lee Circle.From the Take Em Down Nola website:TAKE EM DOWN NOLA CALLS FOR PEOPLES CELEBRATION & SECOND LINE TO BURY WHITE SUPREMACYWhile white supremacists gather from many states around confederate monuments in OUR CITY, the mayor nor council has still not publicly called for its own ceremony to honor the historic occasion of 4 monuments to slavery coming down. Even the conservative governor of S.C. had a public ceremony to remove the confederate flag. Cowering in darkness offers no safety or protection, it is shameful and being questioned by world wide media.We the people of New Orleans demand that the Mayor and City Council take immediate action to remove all monuments, school names and street signs dedicated to White Supremacists. These structures litter our city with visual reminders of the horrid legacy of slavery that terrorized so many of this city s ancestors. They misrepresent our community. We demand the freedom to live in a city where we are not forced to pay taxes for the maintenance of public symbols that demean us and psychologically terrorize us. We demand:1.That the city release a timeline for the immediate removal of the monuments; 2.That the city expand the definition from 4 specific monuments to encompass all monuments to White Supremacy 3.That the city develop a community driven process for the removal of the monuments and the choosing of their replacements.Not everyone agrees with Take Em Down Nola that Confederate statues are a sign of racism. One of the most vocal defenders of the Confederate flag and of the Confederate statues in New Orleans is black female conservative activist Arlene Barnum. Barnum is pictured below with her friend, author and popular pro-Confederate flag speaker Anthony Hervey. Barnum was with when she says he was killed by 4-5 black youths after attending a pro-confederate flag rally in Mississippi. According to Barnum, she and Hervey were guest speakers at the rally in Mississippi. As they were leaving the rally, the SUV driven by Hervey was chased down by a silver car with 4-5 young black men inside. During the chase, he lost control of his car, it flipped and he was killed. Apparently his life didn t matter to the black community, as they never uttered a word about his suspicious death:PUBLIC NOTICE.. LISTEN UP very carefully. If anyone of you who claim to be pro-Confederate, but who are anti-Confederate Battle flag, then REMOVE yourself from my friends list. And be quick about it.If you are against the displaying of the Confederate Battle Flag in public, then REMOVE yourself from my friends list. Do it now!If you are advocating that people NOT bring Confederate Battle Flag into New Orleans at the endangered Confederate monuments, then REMOVE yourself from my friends list. And be quick as lickity split!As far as I know, I don t have any BLM folks on my friends list. And when I catch em thru the cracks, I remove & block them with the most extreme prejudice. However, in the case of these self-professed pro Confederate folks who have issues with that battle flag emblem, I will give them the respect, dignity & the curtesy to REMOVE themselves. I m giving them 72 hrs.In photo, the man to the left, Anthony Hervey is a Mississippian who was not afraid to publicly display the Confederate battle flag. As a colored man, he has been vilified, attacked, physically assaulted, called all sorts of racial insults that not even the average white Confederate flaggers had endured. But yet he kept on flagging proudly until the day he was killed. So don t give me that sh*t excuse to justify hiding the Confederate Battle flag to avoid being called a racist. I guarantee you that EVERY colored Confederate flagger I know have been called much worse & treated with violence & are the 1st to be targeted at public venues.You better not be black and support free speech or a Confederate monument in America or expect to be threatened by the left. This is no joke. Facebook user Gene Black threatened a black Confederate statue supporter s family while he s in New Orleans on his wall 4 days ago:Much like ISIS, pro-Confederate monument removal groups like Take Em Down Nola and communist groups like Antifa plan to come together to threaten free speech and freedom of expression.Black Rebel posted this image with the following message: words cannot described the friendships built after fighting side by side. on his Facebook page: Black Rebel also posted this video of an anti-free speech leftist launching a glass bottle, just missing the head of a fellow pro-confederate monument protester. Watch how the police take their time walking over to the area from where the bottle was thrown. You can hear the free speech protesters yelling, Do something! to the police officers as they appear to be in no hurry to do anything about it. Let s hope this is not an example of how police plan to respond to any potential acts of violence today, or things are likely to get very ugly very quickly: New Orleans Police Department held a press conference on Saturday where they made the public aware they are planning to keep the citizens of New Orleans safe and will keep the protesters safe from violence and from the threat of violence. Police Chief Harrison also makes it clear that they will take swift action for anyone who violates the law. Chief Harrison also makes clear that while they respect the rights of citizens to open carry weapons in New Orleans, that those weapons are not allowed at a public protest:Watch the response from American Warrior Revolution member to New Orleans Police Chief Harrison s press conference:',\n",
              " 'A male colleague grabbing her leg. Another one suggestively rubbing her back. Others at work dinners discussing who they\\'d want to sleep with. Jane Park talked about experiencing all of this behavior in her career in business consulting and strategy. Never has she reported any of it to human resources or management. \"It\\'s made into such a big deal that you have to make a decision: Do you want to ruin your career? Do you want this to be everything that you end up being about?\" said Ms. Park, who is now chief executive of Julep, a beauty company she founded. \"What you really want to happen is that it doesn\\'t happen again. \" Her choice is more common than not, social science research shows. Employers, judges and juries often use women\\'s failure to report harassment as evidence that it was not a problem or that plaintiffs had other motives. But only a quarter to a third of people who have been harassed at work report it to a supervisor or union representative, and 2 percent to 13 percent file a formal complaint, according to a of studies by Lilia Cortina of the University of Michigan and Jennifer Berdahl of the University of British Columbia Sauder School of Business. Mostly they fear retaliation, and with good reason, research shows. In response to a New York Times report this month of payouts to women who had accused the Fox news host Bill O\\'Reilly of sexual harassment, 21st Century Fox, Fox News\\'s parent company, said: \"No current or former Fox News employee ever took advantage of the 21st Century Fox hotline to raise a concern about Bill O\\'Reilly, even anonymously. \" In interviews, women who worked at Fox said they didn\\'t complain to human resources because they feared they would be fired. Some women who experience harassment confront the perpetrator or confide in friends or family, the found. But the most common response is to avoid the person, play down what happened or ignore the behavior. Some don\\'t report a problem because they don\\'t think their experience qualifies as illegal harassment. An analysis of 55 representative surveys found that about 25 percent of women report having experienced sexual harassment, but when they are asked about specific behaviors, like inappropriate touching or pressure for sexual favors, the share roughly doubles. Those numbers are broadly consistent with other survey findings. Many victims, who are most often women, fear they will face disbelief, inaction, blame or societal and professional retaliation. That could be hostility from supervisors, a bad reference to future employers or the loss of job opportunities. Their fears are grounded in reality, researchers have concluded. In one study of employees, of workers who had complained about mistreatment described some form of retaliation in a survey. \"They become troublemakers â€” nobody wants to hire them or work with them anymore,\" Ms. Berdahl said. Paradoxically, official harassment policies and grievance procedures often end up creating obstacles to women\\'s ability to assert their rights, according to research by Marshall, a sociologist at the University of Illinois. \"That is in part because companies put them into place as mini litigation defense centers,\" Ms. Marshall said. \"The way employers deal with it is to prepare to show a court or jury that they did everything they could, rather than to protect women in the workplace. \" There are many ways that company cultures discourage people who are harassed from reporting it. Sometimes the harasser is a superstar â€” someone who makes the company so much money that he feels powerful and uninhibited in his behavior because the company has considerable incentive to look the other way. The more someone has a reputation for harassing, the less likely a woman is to complain, Ms. Berdahl said: \"It\\'s natural to conclude that if he\\'s been getting away with this for a long time, then the organization tolerates it, so why become the problem yourself by going to H. R.?\" Other times the human resources department has no interest in helping the employee â€” or there is no such department at all. This is common in Silicon Valley, where companies grow so fast â€” and where disdain for bureaucracy runs so deep â€” that human resources officials often serve only to recruit employees. In February, a former Uber engineer, Susan Fowler, wrote that when she reported to the Uber human resources department that her manager had tried persuading her to have sex with him on her first official day on her new team, the department declined to take action. It said she could change teams or accept what would probably be a poor performance review from the manager. Uber has a new human resources executive and is doing an internal investigation. Ellen Pao, a former partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers, described an atmosphere of sexism and harassment at the venture capital firm â€” with little recourse. In fact, it had no human resources department. She sued and lost a trial. Organizations that are very hierarchical or masculine can breed more harassment, and less reporting of it, according to studies, because gendered power dynamics are a big driver. That\\'s one reason that harassment has been rampant â€” and underreported â€” in the military. Most sizable companies have policies banning sexual harassment and require some sort of training in what it is and how to report it. But much of the training has been shown to be ineffective, and at worst can backfire. The best way to avoid sexual harassment and ensure that it\\'s reported when it happens is to bake it into company culture, from the top leaders on down, executives and researchers say. \"When you have an effective H. R. department that is supported by leadership, people feel safe about reporting harassment,\" said Bettina Deynes, vice president for H. R. at the Society for Human Resource Management, a professional association. \"It has a lot to do with the type of H. R. department: The motive is not the legal liability, but the culture you want. \" Culture is a squishy concept, but companies can do concrete things. One counterintuitive idea is to reward managers when complaints of harassment increase in their department, because it means they\\'re creating an environment where people are comfortable reporting it, according to a frank report published in June by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Here are some other ideas from the commission and researchers in the field: â–  Authorize dozens of employees throughout the organization to receive complaints, so that people can report to someone they\\'re comfortable with. â–  Hire an ombudsman. â–  Promote more women to positions of power. â–  Train people not in what not to do, but in how to be civil to colleagues, and how to speak up as a bystander â€” and have senior leaders attend the training sessions. â–  Put in proportional consequences, so that instances can be handled with conversations instead of firings or legal action. Ms. Pao, now the chief diversity and inclusion partner at the Kapor Center, a research, advisory and investment group that tries to make the tech industry more diverse, says she is pessimistic that company cultures will change unless it starts at the very top. \"If you could fix the problem, then everybody could move on and thrive,\" she said. \"But often it\\'s not just the one bad player, so you may want to get out of the culture. \"',\n",
              " 'Dressed in a thick jacket and wool hat on a cool winter evening, counting the coins for his bus fare, Hedi Hammami looks like any other Tunisian on his way to work. But he walks with a limp and sometimes pauses midspeech and screws up his face in pain. \"That\\'s GuantÃ¡namo,\" he explains. After eight years as a detainee in the United States detention facility in GuantÃ¡namo Bay, Cuba, he says he still suffers from headaches, depression and anxiety attacks from the torture and other mistreatment he says he suffered there, even six years after his release. Married with two children now and employed as a nighttime ambulance driver, Mr. Hammami, 47, seems to have rebuilt his life. Yet the pressures of living in Tunisia\\'s faltering democracy, under harassment and enduring repeated raids by the police, have driven him to make an extreme request. \"It would be better for me to go back to that single cell and to be left alone,\" he said recently. \"Two or three weeks ago I went to the Red Cross and asked them to connect me to the U. S. foreign ministry to ask to go back to GuantÃ¡namo. \" The Red Cross refused to take his request, he said, but he insists nevertheless that at this point, that would be best for him. \"I have lost my hope,\" he says. \"There is no future in this country for me. \" When he was first released from GuantÃ¡namo in 2010, Tunisia was still a dictatorship under the rule of President Zine Ben Ali and notorious for torturing prisoners, in particular Islamists. Deemed no longer a threat to the United States, Mr. Hammami was sent to the former Soviet republic of Georgia. After the popular uprising in 2011 that overthrew Mr. Ben Ali and set off the Arab Spring, Mr. Hammami negotiated his return to Tunisia. He timed it well, benefiting from a national amnesty for political prisoners and a program of compensation that gave him a job in the Ministry of Health. \"I hoped very much that after the revolution everything would get better,\" he said in one of several interviews in his rented home in a suburb of Tunis. Yet, soon after he began work in 2013, the police raided his apartment with dogs at 3 a. m. breaking the door and hauling him down to the police station. \"They made me crawl on all fours down the stairs,\" he recounted. At the police station they said they just wanted to get to know him, and let him go after 15 minutes. \"That was just the beginning. \" Since then, Mr. Hammami has lived under a constant regimen of police surveillance, raids and harassment. His cellphone and computer were confiscated. When he moved to a new house, the police followed him, turning up at all hours to question him. In December 2015 he was placed under house arrest, told he no longer had the right to work and ordered to sign in at the police station morning and evening for six weeks. He remains under \"administrative control,\" and the police enforce the order at will. He cannot travel outside Tunis. Every so often, like on Sept. 11, the police order him to sign in with them. \"I feel someone is doing it for revenge,\" he says. The police have also scared landlords from renting to him, forcing him to move six times in three years. His Algerian wife\\'s residency card was confiscated, preventing her from working to supplement his meager salary. The family is barely managing, she said, asking not to be named for fear of further police harassment. Stress and tension from the police actions have intensified the psychological problems Mr. Hammami brought with him from GuantÃ¡namo. \"I feel too much pressure,\" he said, rubbing his temples. \"All that blackness comes back. \" Rim Ben Ismail, a psychologist working for the World Organization Against Torture in Tunisia, who has counseled 12 Tunisians who were detained in GuantÃ¡namo, says Mr. Hammadi\\'s wish to return to his cell is fairly typical of the GuantÃ¡namo detainees. \"They lived with suffering, physical suffering,\" she said in an interview. \"But now there is a psychic suffering, and often they say, \\'Take me back there. \\'\" \"Because of their past they are all presumed guilty and it is unlivable for all of them and their families,\" she added. \"The families are being threatened and harassed. \" Parents in particular fear the Tunisian security forces and say they think their sons would be safer in GuantÃ¡namo, she added. Raids have often been needlessly violent, she said police officials break down doors and wake a suspect with a gun to his head, often in front of his wife and children. \"Everything is being done to create aggression in a person,\" she said. \"They do not need to raid the house at 2 a. m. \" One of her former GuantÃ¡namo patients was harassed so relentlessly by police that he became suicidal and ran off to Syria, where he was killed. \"He was such a gentle person,\" she said sadly. \"By treating these people like this you create a climate of revenge and the sense that they have no place at home. \" There is no doubt that Tunisia has a terrorism problem. It has been grappling with attacks from Al groups since 2013. The violence escalated to spectacular attacks in 2015 and 2016 that killed more than 70 people, many of them foreign tourists at a national museum and at a beach resort hotel. Moreover, Tunisians reportedly make up the largest number of foreign fighters to have joined the Islamic State and other extremist groups in Syria and Iraq, and some have been encouraged to conduct attacks when they return home. After an attack killed 12 members of the presidential guard in November 2015, the government imposed a state of emergency. At least 139 Tunisians have been placed under house arrest since, according to Human Rights Watch, which documented the cases in a report released in September. The sanctions have been justified in the context of countering terrorism but have \"left people facing stigmatization and unable to pursue studies and work,\" it stated. International human rights officials have voiced growing concerns of abuses resurfacing in Tunisia. In a report released this week, Amnesty International accused the Tunisian police and security forces of employing repressive measures used by past dictatorships, including torture, deaths in custody, arbitrary house raids and often unlawful harassment of suspects, their families and communities. Ben Emmerson, the United Nations special rapporteur for human rights while countering terrorism, said during a recent visit to Tunisia that human rights should be central to counterterrorism operations, noting that torture and other repressive measures fuel radicalism. Mr. Hammami says he feels the police are pushing him that way. The son of a farmer from Tunisia\\'s poor northwest, he says he originally left for Italy in 1986 in search of work. There he fell in with an Islamic missionary group, Tablighi Jamaat, and later traveled to Pakistan, where he obtained refugee status. He was arrested in Pakistan and handed over to the American military in 2002 and transferred to GuantÃ¡namo, where he was accused of training in Qaeda camps in Afghanistan. The Americans also say they found his identification papers in Tora Bora, the last redoubt of Osama bin Laden in the country, according to papers released by WikiLeaks. Mr. Hammami, who denies going to Afghanistan or having any links to Qaeda or terrorism, was eventually released without charge. Whatever his past, he says after nearly 20 years away, he just wants to live quietly. \"I never committed a crime,\" he said. \"I don\\'t have a record, no theft, no ethics problems, nothing. \" \"My only demand is to be stable, but they don\\'t let me live my life in stability,\" he said. \"They are pushing you towards death. \"',\n",
              " 'by Dr. Mercola  A new federal report revealed that the majority of U.S. adults (more than 54 percent) had some type of musculoskeletal pain disorder such as back, joint or neck pain in 2012 (the latest year for which statistics are available). [1]  Its prevalence is indicative of the significant price Americans pay for pain â€” it\\'s a leading cause of disability and major contributor to health care expenses and disability compensation.  Also revealing, people suffering from pain were significantly more likely to have used a complementary health approach compared to people without pain â€” nearly 42 percent versus 24 percent, respectively.  The reason wasn\\'t addressed by the study, but time and again, conventional medicine fails to relieve many people\\'s pain.  Congressional testimony from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) stated that Americans consume 80 percent of the pain pills in the world, [2] and in a survey of more than 2,000 pain patients in the U.S., most said they were taking a dangerously addictive opioid pain medication. [3]  Research suggests, however, that these drugs work for only about three months, after which changes in your brain may lead to increased feelings of pain along with added emotional upset, including feelings of hopelessness and desperation. [4]  Many pain sufferers have tried virtually every treatment that conventional medicine has to offer â€” medications, injections, surgery and more â€” only to find that their pain hasn\\'t gotten better and they may be struggling with treatment-induced side effects as well (one of the worst of which is opioid addiction ).  At that point (and for many far sooner), it\\'s only natural that you would begin to seek other options, which brings many people to holistic, complementary or \"alternative\" health care options for relief. Science-Backed Natural Pain Relief Options  A recent study published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings evaluated several complementary approaches for pain relief. [5] The options that follow have been scientifically proven to help with relief, according to the report.  Acupuncture  One of the most common uses for acupuncture is in treating chronic pain. One analysis of the most robust studies available concluded that acupuncture has a clear effect in reducing chronic pain, more so than standard pain treatment. [6]  Study participants receiving acupuncture reported an average 50 percent reduction in pain, compared to a 28 percent pain reduction for standard pain treatment without acupuncture. It\\'s likely that acupuncture works via a variety of mechanisms.  In 2010, for instance, it was found that acupuncture activates pain-suppressing receptors and increases the concentration of the neurotransmitter adenosine in local tissues [7] (adenosine slows down your brain\\'s activity and induces sleepiness).  Massage Therapy  A systematic review and meta-analysis, published in the journal Pain Medicine, included 60 high-quality and seven low-quality studies that looked into the use of massage for various types of pain, including muscle and bone pain, headaches, deep internal pain, fibromyalgia pain and spinal cord pain. [8]  The review revealed that massage therapy relieves pain better than getting no treatment at all.  Relaxation Techniques  Breathing exercises, guided imagery, meditation and other relaxation techniques may provide relief, especially from pain from tension headaches and migraines.  Research by an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, Dr. Herbert Benson, found that people who practice relaxation methods such as yoga and meditation long-term have more disease-fighting genes switched \"on\" and active, including genes that protect against pain and rheumatoid arthritis. [9]  Exercise  Among people who had experienced back pain , those who exercised had a 25 percent to 40 percent lower risk of having another episode within a year than those who did no exercise. [10]  Strength exercises, aerobics, flexibility training and stretching were all beneficial in lowering the risk of back pain.  Motor control exercises (MCE), which help to improve coordination of muscles that support your spine,11 may also help. One systematic review found MCE led to reductions in pain and disability and improvements in perceived quality of life compared with minimal intervention. [12]  Yoga , which is particularly useful for promoting flexibility and core muscles, has also been proven to be beneficial if you suffer from back pain.  People suffering from low back pain who took one yoga class a week had greater improvements in function than those receiving medicine or physical therapy. [13] The Yoga Journal has an online page demonstrating specific poses that may be helpful. [14]  Medical Marijuana  There are cannabinoid receptors in your brain, lungs, liver, kidneys, immune system and more. Both the therapeutic and psychoactive properties of marijuana occur when a cannabinoid activates a cannabinoid receptor.  Research is still ongoing on just how extensive their impact is on our health, but to date it\\'s known that cannabinoid receptors play an important role in many body processes, including metabolic regulation, cravings, pain, anxiety, bone growth and immune function. [15]  Some of the strongest research to date is focused on marijuana for pain relief. In one study, just three puffs of marijuana a day for five days helped those with chronic nerve pain to relieve pain and sleep better. [16]  Also revealing, in states where medical marijuana is legal, overdose deaths from opioids like morphine, oxycodone and heroin decreased by an average of 20 percent after one year, 25 percent after two years and 33 percent by years five and six. [17] Turmeric for Pain Relief  Turmeric was once most known for being a flavorful and colorful addition to curry, but in the scientific world, turmeric has earned a reputation for being a multi-faceted healer. Turmeric contains curcumin, which has notable anti-inflammatory properties.  It can inhibit both the activity and the synthesis of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) and 5-lipooxygenase (5-LOX), as well as other enzymes that have been implicated in inflammation.  A 2006 study found that a turmeric extract composed of curcuminoids (curcumin is the most investigated curcuminoid) blocked inflammatory pathways, effectively preventing the launch of a protein that triggers swelling and pain. [18]  Turmeric has been found to significantly improve post-operative pain and fatigue, [19] and in a study of osteoarthritis patients, those who added only 200 milligrams (mg) of curcumin a day to their treatment plan had reduced pain and increased mobility.  Time magazine even published the story of one doctor who marveled at one of his older hip patient\\'s lack of pain and remarkably swift recovery from surgery. The patient took turmeric regularly, and the results so impressed the physician that he began taking the supplement himself. [20] Essential Oils for Pain Relief  Essential oils are concentrated, aromatic plant extracts that have been used for thousands of years for emotional, cosmetic, medical and even spiritual purposes. One of their most popular uses is also for relief of chronic and acute pain.  There are a number of ways to use essential oils , including via aromatherapy. Lavender aromatherapy, for instance, has been shown to lessen pain following needle insertion [21] while green apple scent significantly relieves migraine pain . Other essential oils noted for pain relief, including relief from joint pain, include: [22] Lavender',\n",

The editorial board of the Des Moines Register writes: \"After 57 years in elected office and countless legislative accomplishments at both the state and federal level, Grassley seems destined to be remembered largely for this single, petulant act of politically motivated obstructionism... Over the course of six terms in the U.S. Senate, three terms in the U.S. House, and 16 years in the Iowa Legislature, Grassley cultivated a reputation for being a fair-minded, hard-working, bipartisan lawmaker. That well-deserved reputation is now badly damaged - perhaps irretrievably so.\" President Obama: Trump candidacy a key reason to confirm Garland now Today, President Obama weighed in on Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, saying it should incentivize Senate Republicans to confirm Chief Judge Garland now. In a live interview with Chris Geidner, Buzzfeed reports: \"The GOP is \\'looking at a Republican nominee\\' - Donald Trump - \\'who many of them say isn\\'t qualified to be president much less appoint someone\\' to the Supreme Court.... But now, \\'it seems to me [Republicans would] be better off going ahead and giving a hearing and a vote to somebody that they themselves in the past have said is well-qualified, is fair, and to treat the Supreme Court with the seriousness and the sense that it\\'s beyond politics, that it deserves,\\' Obama said. \\'Precisely because this election year has been so crazy, precisely because you have a number of Republicans who have said that they\\'re concerned about their nominee, it shows you why you don\\'t want to politicize a Supreme Court appointment.\\'\" Supreme Court punts on major case, showing the importance of a full and functioning high court.

              " 'Gay Mafia descends in 5 4 3 2 1 Given the current body of evidence, the American College of Pediatricians believes it is inappropriate, potentially hazardous to children, and dangerously irresponsible to change the age-old prohibition on same-sex parenting, whether by adoption, foster care, or reproductive manipulation, they conclude. This position is rooted in the best available science. A Utah juvenile court judge ruled Tuesday that a 1-year-old girl, who has been in the care of lesbian foster parents, cannot be adopted by them and should be sent to a more traditional home, says the Utah Division of Child and Family Services.According to CNN, the case is the first major challenge to same-sex adoption rights. LGBT civil rights groups are outraged over the ruling.While Judge Scott Johansen is not commenting on his decision publicly per the Utah Code of Judicial Conduct April Hoagland, one of the lesbians, married over a year ago to Beckie Peirce, told KUTV that Johansen said research indicates children in homosexual homes do not do as well as they do in heterosexual homes. [W]hen they asked to show his research he would not, Hoagland added.Hoagland and Peirce were approved as foster parents by the division of family services and are raising Peirce s two children. They say the state and the child s biological mother are supportive of their desire to adopt the child.As CBS reports, the two women are part of a group of same-sex couples who were permitted to become foster parents in Utah following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. Deborah Lindner, a spokeswoman for the Utah Foster Care Foundation, which trains foster parents for the state, said about 20 same-sex couples are caring for children in the foster program. Heartbreaking. We ve been told to take care like a mother would and I m her mother, and that s who she knows and she s just going to be taken away in seven days to probably another good, loving home, Hoagland said. But it s not fair, and it s not right, and it hurts me very badly, because I have done nothing wrong. Removing a child from a loving home simply because the parents are LGBT is outrageous, shocking and unjust, Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement. It also flies in the face of overwhelming evidence that children being raised by same-sex parents are just as healthy and well-adjusted as those with different-sex parents. At a time when so many children in foster care need loving homes, it is sickening to think that a child would be taken from caring parents who planned to adopt, he added.Utah child and family services said they are reviewing the ruling to determine their options, including whether to challenge the order. This is the first time there has been an attempt to deprive gay foster parents of their rights to care for an adoptive child, said CNN legal analyst Paul Callan. I believe it was a bizarre and highly unusual decision by the judge based most probably on religious beliefs rather than scientific facts. He predicted the case would be overturned by Utah appeals courts.In 2012, however, sociologist Mark Regnerus of the University of Texas at Austin published research in the journal Social Science Research on a large, random sample of Americans of ages 18-39 who were raised in different types of families. The study of some 3,000 adults found numerous differences that exist among the various family arrangements and that outcomes for children of gay and lesbian parents were suboptimal. In another study by Loren Marks of Louisiana State University also published in Social Science Research Marks debunked a 2005 policy brief on same-sex parents by the American Psychological Association (APA), in which the organization analyzed 59 studies and concluded [n]ot a single study has found children of lesbian or gay parents to be disadvantaged in any significant respect relative to children of heterosexual parents. Marks observed that 55 of the studies analyzed by APA did not even provide evidence of statistical power in accord with APA s own standards. [N]ot one of the 59 studies referenced in the 2005 APA Brief compares a large, random, representative sample of lesbian or gay parents and their children with a large, random, representative sample of married parents and their children, Marks noted. [W]e have been left with large, scientifically strong studies showing children do best with their married mother and father but which do not make comparisons with homosexual parents or couples, observed Peter Sprigg, senior fellow for policy studies at Family Research Council, and studies which purportedly show that children of homosexuals do just as well as other children but which are methodologically weak and thus scientifically inconclusive. However, Regnerus s research, called the New Family Structures Study, included comparisons with children raised by same-sex parents and surveyed young adults about their experiences growing up in their family situations as well as their current life. Unlike other studies, Regnerus also did not rely on reports of children, while they were still living in their homes, or the potentially biased reports of the parents.Regnerus found that children of homosexuals fared worse on 77 out of 80 outcome measures that compared children with same-sex parents to those from other family arrangements. Specifically, compared with children raised by married, biological parents, children of homosexual parents are more likely to be on public assistance, have lower educational attainment, and report both less safety in their childhood families and more continued negative impact from them. In addition, children of same-sex parents were found to more likely suffer from depression, to have been arrested more often, and to have had more male and female sexual partners if they are female.For children of lesbian mothers, statistical significance in both direct comparisons and with control subjects was found in numerous areas in Regnerus s research. Children of lesbian mothers were found to be four times more likely to be on welfare, more than three times more likely to be unemployed, nearly ten times more likely to have been touched sexually by a parent or other adult caregiver, and nearly four times as likely to have been physically forced to have sex against their will.Despite numerous statistically significant correlations in his study and his carefully controlled methodology, Regnerus still cautions these relationships do not indicate causality. Still, as Sprigg noted, The large number of significant negative outcomes in this study gives legitimate reason for concern about the consequences of homosexual parenting. According to Drs. Michelle Cretella and Den Trumbull:[M]others and fathers parent differently and make unique contributions to the overall development of the child. Psychological theory of child development has always recognized the critical role that mothers play in the healthy development of children. More recent research reveals that when fathers are absent, children suffer as well. Girls without fathers perform more poorly in school, are more likely to be sexually active and become pregnant as teenagers. Boys without fathers have higher rates of delinquency, violence, and aggression. [T]radition and science agree that biological ties and dual gender parenting are protective for children, the doctors continue. The limited research advocating childrearing by same-sex parents has severe methodological limitations. There is significant risk of harm inherent in exposing a child to the homosexual lifestyle.',\n",
              " 'MELBOURNE, Australia â€” \"So Ivan, are you calling Andy \\'Sir\\'?\" Ivan Lendl paused and then laughed, which would surely seem strange to those who know him only as Andy Murray\\'s coach in the front row of the players\\' box. \"Definitely not,\" Lendl said, chuckling some more before heading off down the crowded main hallway inside Rod Laver Arena at the Australian Open. Clearly, not much has changed in the Murray camp since his remarkable stretch run to the No. 1 ranking and a knighthood in 2016. He is still tough on himself on court and on the changeovers. Still Andy â€” not Sir Andy â€” to his peers and mentor in chief, Lendl. Still deadpan and droll with his voice that sounds as if it emanates from a mine shaft. Asked on Monday by the interviewer John Fitzgerald how Murray\\'s wife, Kim, was handling the transition to Lady Kim, Murray said, \"No more swearing during my matches, for anyone who saw that a few years ago. \" He was referring to Kim\\'s courtside language during his semifinal victory over Tomas Berdych at the 2015 Australian Open. Her tirade did not go unnoticed, and she returned for the final cheekily wearing a shirt that read, \"Parental advisory explicit content. \" Presumably, Lady Kim won\\'t be wearing that sort of thing in the players\\' box from here on, either (or at least she wasn\\'t on Monday). \"I haven\\'t found it distracting really,\" Murray said of the knighthood. \"I mean, I found out about it four or five weeks ago. Maybe if it happened a day or so, two days before the tournament. But I\\'ve had enough time to get my head around it. \" Just as he has had plenty of time to prepare himself for the role of No. 1, however long it lasts. I asked him on Monday, after his stuttering (5) victory over Illya Marchenko, if there had been any downside to No. 1, thinking he might bring up extra demands or burdens. \"No,\" he said. \"It\\'s been great. I think because it\\'s taken me so long to get there, obviously I want to try to stay there. But also I feel like I\\'m mature enough now to handle it. Maybe if it happens when you\\'re very young, you might feel extra pressures. The responsibilities might feel a bit much, but I think because I\\'m much older and more mature, it\\'s been good. \" The conventional tennis wisdom is that it is harder to hang on at the top than to reach the top. \"I hope not,\" Murray said. But for anyone who believes that he now has nowhere to go but down, that is hardly true in Australia. He has reached five singles finals in Melbourne and lost all five. No man has done so well at any Grand Slam tournament without breaking through to win the title. Others have lost five finals in the same major event, including Lendl, who lost five at the United States Open. But he also won three. Bill Johnston lost six finals at the United States Championships, but won the event twice. John Bromwich lost five finals at the Australian Championships in the era, but won the title twice, too. Murray, at 29, is in unfortunately uncharted territory, all the more so because Novak Djokovic ended his own long run of frustration at the French Open last year by finally taking the title after reaching four semifinals and three finals. \"Look, it\\'s still a remarkable record, five Slam finals in Australia, and deep down I think it means an enormous amount to Andy to finally complete the puzzle,\" said Roger Rasheed, the Australian who once coached Lleyton Hewitt when Hewitt was chasing the title here without success. But Hewitt reached only one final in Melbourne. Murray is here and has a better winning percentage at the Australian Open than at any other Grand Slam tournament except Wimbledon. \"Andy\\'s been so close,\" Rasheed said. \"What more does he have to do? Well, it\\'s not a matter of big changes. It\\'s just been a matter of points and the moments. \" It\\'s a matter of the opposition, too. The first of Murray\\'s Australian Open defeats in the final came against Roger Federer in 2010. The last four came against Djokovic in 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2016. \"Andy played Roger in his prime and has been playing Novak in his prime,\" Rasheed said. \"It\\'s a handful of points changing the way the match falls. Andy\\'s showing he\\'s in his prime now. He just needs to get there and roll the dice again. \" Murray\\'s timing may still not be quite right. He played a great deal of tennis down the stretch in 2016 and was beaten by Djokovic in a final in Doha, Qatar, to start this season. Freshness just might be a factor down the stretch as well as Djokovic\\'s eagerness to restore the pecking order. But it does not seem quite right in light of their abilities that Djokovic has six Australian Open titles and Murray has not even one. He broke down in tears after losing to Federer in 2010. He stared vacantly into space after losses to Djokovic and sportingly came up with the right words amid major disappointment. And yet he insisted on Monday that his emotions were not mixed when he thought about this tournament. \"Honestly, they\\'re totally positive,\" said Murray, who plays Andrey Rublev in the second round on Wednesday. \"I\\'ve had a lot of tough losses here, for sure. But I love it here. Played some great matches as well, but just haven\\'t managed to win the final. But, you know, I keep coming back to try. I\\'ll keep doing that until I\\'m done, but I still feel like I\\'ve got a few years left to try and do it. \" He is, by any measure, due for a change of fortune in Melbourne. And if you like your sports with foreshadowing, the only other top tennis player to receive a knighthood was Sir Norman Brookes, the Australian star of the early 20th century. Guess whose name has been given to the trophy awarded to the men\\'s champion at the Australian Open?',\n",
              " 'When the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, said on Tuesday that his investigators had no \"direct evidence\" that Hillary Clinton\\'s email account had been \"successfully hacked,\" both private experts and federal investigators immediately understood his meaning: It very likely had been breached, but the intruders were far too skilled to leave evidence of their work. Mr. Comey described, in fairly blistering terms, a set of email practices that left Mrs. Clinton\\'s systems wide open to Russian and Chinese hackers, and an array of others. She had no cybersecurity professional monitoring her system. She took her BlackBerry everywhere she went, \"sending and receiving emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. \" Her use of \"a personal email domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent. \" In the end, the risks created by Mrs. Clinton\\'s insistence on keeping her communications on a private server may prove to be a larger issue than the relatively small amount of classified data investigators said they found on her system. But the central mystery â€” who got into the system, if anyone â€” may never be resolved. \"Reading between the lines and following Comey\\'s logic, it does sound as if the F. B. I. believes a compromise of Clinton\\'s email is more likely than not,\" said Adam Segal, the author of \"Hacked World Order,\" who studies cyberissues at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"Sophisticated attackers would have known of the existence of the account, would have targeted it and would not have been seen. \" Mr. Comey couched his concern on Tuesday by repeating the intelligence community\\'s favorite phrase â€” \"we assess\" â€” four times, but ultimately reached no conclusion. \"We assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton\\'s personal email account,\" he said. But that was notable: Until Mr. Comey spoke, Mrs. Clinton and her campaign have said that her server â€” there were actually several, in succession â€” was never hacked. A State Department inspector general\\'s report issued this year reported what looked like several attempts at \"spear phishing\" â€” fake emails intended to get a user to click on a link that would install malware on a computer â€” but there is no evidence that those links were activated. Mrs. Clinton, and her campaign, have always maintained that the server was secure. President Obama backed her up in an interview last October on CBS\\'s \"60 Minutes. \" \"I don\\'t think it posed a national security problem,\" he said. But Mr. Comey painted a different picture. \"Hostile actors gained access to the private commercial email accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact,\" he said. And that would have meant that tracking the trail of electronic breadcrumbs back to her server would have been a pretty simple task. After that, their ability to break in would have been a mix of skill and luck, but they had plenty of time to get it right. Mrs. Clinton\\'s best defense, and one she cannot utter in public, is that whatever the risks of keeping her own email server, that server was certainly no more vulnerable than the State Department\\'s. Had she held an unclassified account in the State Department\\'s official system, as the rules required, she certainly would have been hacked. Russian intruders were thoroughly inside that system for years â€” since at least 2007 â€” before the State Department shut its system down several times to perform a digital exorcism in late 2014, nearly two years after Mrs. Clinton left office. Either out of embarrassment or to protect its sources of intelligence, the Obama administration has never publicly blamed Russia for stealing data from the unclassified systems at the State Department and the White House, just as it has never publicly identified China as the culprit in the theft of information on nearly 22 million Americans stored by the Office of Personnel Management. Mrs. Clinton\\'s campaign has insisted that the server did have some cyber protection software, but they have not said what kind. But security software is useless unless it is updated constantly to reflect threats that change every day. Even then, there are ways for a determined, hacker to get in. The best hackers use a gap in the software that has never been discovered before called a \"zero day,\" suggesting there are zero days of warning about its dangers, or they wait for a user error, including clicking on a link. Perhaps Mr. Comey\\'s most surprising suggestion was that Mrs. Clinton had used her private email while in the territory of what he called \"sophisticated adversaries. \" That usually means China and Russia, but could include visits elsewhere, including Eastern Europe. James A. Lewis, a former government cyber security expert who now studies the cyber activities of nations at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said, \"If she used it in Russia or China, they almost certainly picked it up. \" Once the hardware is in a foreign country, and on its phone networks, it is particularly vulnerable. Malware can be placed on it that could turn the phone into a listening device. One lurking question is whether Mrs. Clinton\\'s own practice of taking the phone around the world made it susceptible to tinkering by a foreign government. The State Department worries so much about corrupted cellphones that visitors to the secretary\\'s suite on the seventh floor must place their devices in lockers near the guard\\'s desk. Mrs. Clinton, her campaign said on Wednesday, took her smartphone to the State Department but kept it in a room outside the secure area around her office suite. Moreover, for truly sensitive data, the State Department does not use its own networks at all. It quietly uses a network run by one of the major intelligence agencies, according to officials familiar with the system. That suggests a lack of confidence that State\\'s classified systems can be fully trusted. Since the disclosure that Mrs. Clinton used private email, officials in the government and many outside it have been monitoring the internet, looking to see if any of her messages, or those directed to her, made their way into the public domain. Documents from the Democratic National Committee began circulating after it announced a breach that also appears to have been conducted by Russian intelligence. Nothing from Mrs. Clinton has surfaced. But that does not mean they were not stolen, only that they have not been made public.',\n",

              " 'Investors in financial markets, and those predicting faster economic growth in 2017, would do well to remember the famous words that William McChesney Martin Jr. the former Federal Reserve chairman, uttered way back in 1955: The Fed\\'s job is to remove the punch bowl just as the party gets going. Donald J. Trump\\'s promises to cut taxes and regulation and to increase spending on infrastructure and defense have convinced many that a sugar high in the near term will goose the economy. But Fed officials say the economy is already expanding at something close to its maximum sustainable pace, meaning faster growth would drive inflation toward unwelcome levels. To avoid overheating, the Fed could respond by raising interest rates more quickly. The more Mr. Trump stimulates growth, the faster the Fed is likely to increase rates. \"I guess I would argue that I think people have gotten a bit ahead of themselves about what a Trump presidency would mean,\" said Lewis Alexander, chief United States economist at Nomura. \"If we have a big stimulus, the logical thing for the Fed to do is to raise rates faster. There isn\\'t a whole heck of a lot of scope to just let the economy run under those circumstances. There\\'s a big question about whether fiscal stimulus under Trump just leads to higher interest rates. \" Underscoring that question, the Fed is expected to raise its benchmark rate on Wednesday for the first time since last December in light of new economic data. The rate sits in a range of 0. 25 percent to 0. 5 percent, a low level intended to stimulate economic growth by encouraging borrowing and . Analysts predict the Fed will shift the range upward by a quarter of a percentage point, modestly reducing those incentives. The rate increase is widely regarded as a foregone conclusion. The odds, derived from asset prices, topped 95 percent Monday, according to the CME Group. The looming question is how quickly the Fed will continue to raise rates in 2017. Economic forecasts always require large assumptions, but that is particularly true in the present case because Mr. Trump has provided relatively few details about his plans. Perhaps the most accurate thing that can be said about Mr. Trump\\'s victory is that it has increased the uncertainty of the economic outlook. \"At this juncture, it is premature to reach firm conclusions about what will likely occur,\" William C. Dudley, president of the New York Fed, said in a recent speech. During his campaign, Mr. Trump predicted 4 percent annual growth, and his actions since Election Day point to a goal of job creation. \"Our No. 1 priority is going to be the economy, get back to 3 to 4 percent growth,\" Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Trump\\'s pick to serve as Treasury secretary, said last month. Many economists regard such growth predictions as fanciful the economy has been mired in an extended period of slow growth and the reasons, including an aging population and a dearth of innovation, are unlikely to change quickly. Some think Mr. Trump is more likely to push the economy into recession than to catalyze a new boom. Even if Mr. Trump is right, however, the Fed does not want 4 percent growth. The central bank\\'s outlook has become increasingly gloomy. Officials estimated in September that annual growth of 1. 8 percent was the maximum sustainable pace, and they predicted growth would not exceed 2 percent in the next three years. They will update those forecasts Wednesday, but large shifts are unlikely. Fed officials also are increasingly convinced that steady job growth has substantially eliminated the backlog of people seeking work. The unemployment rate fell to 4. 6 percent in November, a level the Fed regards as healthy. For years, Fed officials urged Congress to increase fiscal spending. Now, Mr. Trump is promising to do just that â€” and the Fed has concluded that it is too late. Stanley Fischer, the Fed\\'s vice chairman, said last month the Fed might still benefit from fiscal stimulus because it could raise rates more quickly. That would increase the Fed\\'s ability to respond to future downturns by reducing interest rates. But such gains would come at real cost: A fiscal stimulus would increase the federal government\\'s debt burden, which already is at a high level by historical standards, reducing the room for a fiscal response to a future downturn. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\\'s chairwoman, urged Congress last month to be mindful that the government is already on the hook for more spending as baby boomers age into retirement. \"With the . D. P. ratio at around 77 percent, there\\'s not a lot of fiscal space, should a shock to the economy occur, an adverse shock, that did require fiscal stimulus,\" she said. The tension between fiscal and monetary policy is likely to unfold in slow motion. Mr. Trump has promised to press for rapid changes in government policy, but Congress is not built for speed. A similar effort to cut taxes at the beginning of the George W. Bush administration, for example, was signed into law on June 7, 2001. The impact of new cuts, and any increase in infrastructure spending that Mr. Trump can persuade dubious Republicans to embrace, would be felt mostly in future years. Mark M. Zandi, chief economist at Moody\\'s Analytics, predicted that tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and spending would fuel faster growth in the first half of Mr. Trump\\'s term. But he said that the Fed\\'s rate increases, and restrictions on trade and immigration, would gradually begin to take a larger toll. By the end, Mr. Zandi predicted, the American economy would be \"unnervingly close\" to recession. \"The Fed and markets in general will ultimately wash out any benefit,\" Mr. Zandi said Monday. \"The economy under President Trump ultimately will be diminished. \" Other economists are more optimistic, predicting that the stimulus will not be fully offset by Fed policy. Mr. Dudley appeared to endorse this view in his recent speech, suggesting that the rise in financial markets was \"broadly appropriate. \" Some of Mr. Trump\\'s proposals also could increase the economy\\'s potential growth rate, for example by improving infrastructure or encouraging corporate investment. On the other hand, the Fed\\'s march toward higher rates may be amplified by the bond market. Rates are already rising, and investors concerned about inflation and larger federal deficits are likely to generate persistent upward pressure. Those effects are already visible. Stock prices have climbed since Mr. Trump\\'s surprising victory, increasing the wealth of shareholders. But borrowing costs also climbed. The average rate on a mortgage loan was 4. 13 percent last week, according to Freddie Mac, up from 3. 54 percent just before the election.',\n",
              " 'Dear Evelyn and Chris, re. proposal review GC04-203, Meko et al. \"A synthesis of 19th century climate data for the United States from paleo, archival and instrumental sources\". I have read the \"Reviewer conflict of interest and confidentiality...\" document and can state that I have no conflict of interest and will abide by the confidentiality provisions etc. I reviewed a very similar proposal by this group 1 year ago, and enclose my review of that proposal below. The new proposal has taken into account my two main concerns from last time, which were: (i) that creation only of a blended data set that contained a time varying mixture of proxy and instrumental data would limit the usefulness because its quality would be time varying, perhaps in an unquantified way, and independent study of errors between proxy and observed data would be prevented; and (ii) that the proposed work was not very innovative in terms of the applications for which the new information would be used. Both of these points have been addressed adequately and so I now rate it \"Excellent (5)\" for scientific/technical merit, and \"High (5)\" for importance/relevance and applicability. One issue that I would like to raise, however, is that the need for quantifying uncertainty/error in the reconstructions/database is not given much coverage in the proposal. It is mentioned, but not focused on. For many applications (testing models, comparison with other reconstructions, detection of unusual climate trends/events), explicitly quantified error estimates are essential. These often change magnitude through time, and thus should be estimated in such a way as to allow this. They may also change with time scale (often being lower for, e.g., a decadal mean than for a single year\\'s value), and again the error estimation method should capture this. I do not think that this issue detracts from the quality of the proposal. Instead I am mentioning it in the hope that this comment can be passed on to the proposers, in the event that the project is funded, so that they can be prompted into placing the appropriate emphasis on quantifying uncertainty. Apologies for being late yet again, and best regards, Tim Date: Thu, 24 Oct 2002 17:14:31 +0000 Subject: confidential assessment of GC03-512 From: Tim Osborn To: CC: , Dear Irma and Chris, Re. proposal review GC03-512, PI: David Meko \"A 19th century data catalog\" First of all, I confirm that there is no conflict of interest etc. Now to my review... (1) Scientific Merit Rating: Good Comments: I completely agree with the rationale behind improving data sets of 19th century climate (see my comments below on \"Relevance to climate change programme\"), and the proposers have identified the most relevant data sources available for the US. The objectives and workplan are generally reasonable, but I have rated it \"good\" rather than \"very good\" or \"excellent\" because it does not seem as scientifically innovative or challenging as it might. Some particular concerns are highlighted below. I am very wary about the proposed approach of integrating the data sources together to produce a single climate product. Obviously the data sources have to be used in combination, for calibration of proxy data or for assessment of possibly dubious early instrumental data, *but* combining them all into a single product only will be very restrictive for future use, assessment, improvements. Much better would be to produce intrumental-only series for whatever length is available, and tree-ring only series for the full length (i.e., into the late 19th and 20th centuries, despite the availability of instrumental data for these periods). Blending them into a single analysis is of some, but limited, use and comparisons of different periods and with (e.g.) model simulations can only ever be done by taking into account error bars that vary dramatically in time and are only estimates of the \"true\" errors - and the error estimates may be underestimates if based only on residuals or covariances during the 20th century. No mention is made of using the 19th century data to consider key issues such as difference between tree-ring and ground borehole temperatures (they differ more in the 19th century, in terms of trend, than in other centuries), possibly taking into account land-use change. No mention is made of using the 19th century data to assess multi-century temperature reconstructions and why they differ. These are issues of great importance. No mention is investigating seasonal dependence of temperature changes, which are greater in existing temperature products during the 19th century than in the 20th century and which has important implications for the calibration of proxy (including tree-ring) data against summer or annual data and the need to more clearly define the true seasonal response of proxy data. Despite these concerns, the proposed work is certainly worthy of funding and the extra items of interest that I mention above could be achieved using the data generated here, in some future project. (2) Relevance to climate change programme Rating: High Comments: The 19th century is certainly of particular importance, not just for the reasons outlined in the proposal but also because this century shows some of the biggest disagreements in warming trend between various quasi-hemispheric temperature reconstructions and between proxy and instrumental data and between different seasons of instrumental data. Additional data sources are definitely required, and additional digitisation, homogenisation and intercomparison of data sets is necessary. For these reasons, work such as that proposed here is essential for helping to refine answers to questions such as how unusual is late twentieth century climate and detection of climate change signals against the noise of natural climate variability.

              " 'In blunt testimony revealed on Tuesday, former managers of Trump University, the school started by Donald J. Trump, portray it as an unscrupulous business that relied on sales tactics, employed unqualified instructors, made deceptive claims and exploited vulnerable students willing to pay tens of thousands for Mr. Trump\\'s insights. One sales manager for Trump University, Ronald Schnackenberg, recounted how he was reprimanded for not pushing a financially struggling couple hard enough to sign up for a $35, 000 real estate class, despite his conclusion that it would endanger their economic future. He watched with disgust, he said, as a fellow Trump University salesman persuaded the couple to purchase the class anyway. \"I believe that Trump University was a fraudulent scheme,\" Mr. Schnackenberg wrote in his testimony, \"and that it preyed upon the elderly and uneducated to separate them from their money. \" For Mr. Trump, whose presidential campaign hinges on his reputation as a businessman, the newly unsealed documents offer an unflattering snapshot of his career since branching out, over the past decade, from building skyscrapers into endeavors that cashed in on his name to sell everything from water and steaks to ties and education. The release of the documents on Tuesday, under court order, was the latest turn in a federal lawsuit, filed in California by dissatisfied former Trump University students, that has bedeviled the businessman since 2010 and could trail him into the White House if he is elected president. Mr. Trump, who started the university in 2005, owned 93 percent of the company. From the start, he acted as its chief promoter, rather than manager, selling it as a tool of financial empowerment that would improve life for thousands of ordinary Americans. It would, he said, \"teach you better than the best business school,\" according to the transcript of a Web video. Within the documents made public Tuesday were internal employee guides encouraging customers with little money to pay for the tuition with their credit cards. \"We teach the technique of using OPM . .. Other People\\'s Money,\" explained the internal instructions for salespeople. The documents pushed employees to exploit the emotions of potential customers. \"Let them know you\\'ve found an answer to their problems,\" read confidential instructions to salespeople. The most striking documents were written testimony from former employees of Trump University who said they had become disenchanted with the university\\'s tactics and culture. Corrine Sommer, an event manager, recounted how colleagues encouraged students to open up as many credit cards as possible to pay for classes that many of them could not afford. \"It\\'s O. K. just max out your credit card,\" Ms. Sommer recalled their saying. Jason Nicholas, a sales executive at Trump University, recalled a deceptive pitch used to lure students â€” that Mr. Trump would be \"actively involved\" in their education. \"This was not true,\" Mr. Nicholas testified, saying Mr. Trump was hardly involved at all. Trump University, Mr. Nicholas concluded, was \"a facade, a total lie. \" Lawyers for Mr. Trump on Tuesday challenged those characterizations, saying that the testimony of the former Trump University employees \"was completely discredited\" in depositions taken for the California lawsuit. Lawyers for Mr. Trump declined to release those depositions on Tuesday. As he has in the past, Mr. Trump argued through representatives that the complaints emanated from a small number of former students and that the vast majority had offered positive reviews of their experience. \"Trump University looks forward to using this evidence, along with much more, to win when the case is brought before a jury,\" said Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump. The court records show the role that Mr. Trump â€” and his outsize reputation â€” played in trying to sell the real estate classes to thousands of students. Marketing materials bearing his signature encouraged prospective students to take advantage of a downturn in the housing market to earn quick profits. He offered the kind of assurances that financial advisers have long cautioned consumers to be wary of. \"How would you like to your financial future,\" Mr. Trump asked in one brochure. Mr. Trump started the Trump University just as the overheated American housing market neared its peak, promising that its classes would impart his wisdom about real estate and moneymaking to the general public. But dozens of complaints about the school rolled into the offices of attorneys general in Florida, Texas, New York and Illinois, officials said, prompting multiple investigations and, eventually, the lawsuit from former students in California. Mr. Trump had fought Tuesday\\'s release of previously sealed documents in the case. In an apparent attempt to discredit the judge in the case, Gonzalo P. Curiel, Mr. Trump called him biased and a \"hater of Donald Trump,\" and he sought to draw attention to the judge\\'s ethnic background â€” \"we believe Mexican,\" Mr. Trump said. (Mr. Curiel was born in Indiana he is of Mexican descent.) On Friday, in response to a legal motion filed by The Washington Post, Judge Curiel ruled that the records be released. Some of the documents unsealed Tuesday were previously made public in connection with other lawsuits. The internal guidebooks for employees of Trump University provide a detailed set of instructions for how to sell the classes, even to skeptical and reluctant consumers, by tapping into their psychological needs. A chart outlines the stages of the \"roller coaster of emotions\" that a buyer will experience. (The \"Blast\" phase, it explains, is \"giving your clients hope again. \" The \"Probe\" phase, it says, must \"slowly bring the client back down to reality. \") When it comes to selling the classes, the guidebooks leave little to chance. Inside the rooms where students are asked to enroll in classes, workers are asked to \"confirm that room temperature is no more than 68 degrees. \" Of course, Mr. Trump and the promise of his engagement with the school was the biggest draw of all. In the documents released Tuesday, instructors described themselves as \" \" by Mr. Trump. But in a deposition related to the lawsuit, Mr. Trump acknowledged that he did not pick the instructors. Not all the documents made public on Tuesday were critical. Many former students said the classes delivered exactly what they had expected. \"Trump University definitely made me more prepared to tackle the \\'real world\\' of real estate investing,\" wrote David Wright Jr. who signed up for a program. \"We really learned a lot of from Trump University and have found a modicum of success,\" wrote another student, Kissy Gordon. Former employees like Ms. Sommer took a dimmer view of the school. In her testimony, she said she was startled by the qualifications of some Trump University instructors. Ms. Sommer recalled that a member of the Trump University sales team, who had previously sold jewelry, was promoted to become an instructor. He had \"no real estate experience,\" she said. She added that many of the instructors had the quality that the school seemed to value most: \"They were skilled at sales,\" she said.',\n",

You should also be interfacing with your counterparts in CE / Political to make sure they are engaged and helping with the lift â€“ can also be a broader discussion about preparing lists / comms plans for the general. Thanks all From: demcommunications@googlegroups.com On Behalf Of Walker, Eric Sent: Wednesday, May 11, 2016 9:13 AM To: demcommunications@googlegroups.com Subject: [COMMUNICATIONS] Press events re: this week\\'s Trump/Ryan meeting Hey everyone â€“ Tomorrow, Donald Trump is coming to Washington D.C. to meet with Paul Ryan, Reince Priebus, and Mitch McConnell. The Ryan meeting is the highlight because Ryan has withheld his endorsement of Trump thus far. This is an ideal opportunity to highlight the historic mess that is the Republican Party, with the Speaker of the House of Representatives not ready to fully endorse his Party\\'s nominee, and a slew of former GOP presidential candidates, former Republican presidents and vulnerable Senate and House candidates trying to distance themselves from their standard bearer. We\\'re asking state party communications directors to put together events around Thursday morning\\'s Trump-Ryan meeting to deliver the message that while Trump and Ryan may have a personal disagreement, they are both pushing the same divisive and dangerous agenda. We\\'re also asking state party communications directors to echo these events with op-eds and letters to the editor in local papers, and surrogates on television and radio. Attached please find a packet with materials to put together an event. In this packet you\\'ll find: Â· Sample talking points / message guidance Â· A sample advisory Â· A sample press release Â· A sample op-ed Â· Four sample letters to the editor DNC can offer national surrogates to appear via satellite or phone on local television and radio broadcasts to amplify the message. Please reach out to walker@dnc.org if you would like to book one of our surrogates. Members of Congress and Senators who are currently in Washington can also use our studio to do local hits. Here\\'s what we\\'re looking for in terms of event logistics: Â· Types of speakers: o State Party Chairs, Vice-Chairs, and EDs o Local Elected Officials o Allied Groups â€“ Planned Parenthood, NAACP, Mi Familia Vota, etc. o Labor o People sharing personal stories Â· About 15-20 supporters Â· Signs that say \"Reject the Trump-Ryan Agenda\" â€“ we have a mockup that can be found here . Â· A big push to get local TV to the event â€“ studies show that local TV is the dominant player in most markets and Americans trust local TV news about 20 points more than they trust national TV news. The Republican Party has elevated offensive policies and extreme voices using divisive campaigns for years, and now they\\'re stuck with Donald Trump\\'s reckless and dangerous campaign heading into the general election. We have to make sure we hold Republicans in Congress and in every state accountable for their Party\\'s dysfunction as they chaotically tumble toward the general election. And while Republicans argue, Democratic voters are overwhelming in agreement that our primary has been exciting, and large majorities would support either one of our candidates. This meeting is also a reminder that what Trump has promised and what Republicans up and down the ballot have pushed for is the same brand of trickle-down economic policies that help those at the top while costing hardworking Americans. It\\'s the same old Republican playbook of cutting taxes for the rich at the expense of middle-class families, opposing measures like equal pay and paid family leave, and reckless policies that would only to drag America back into a recession .

              " 'On Wednesday, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will consider Donald J. Trump\\'s choice of Scott Pruitt, Oklahoma\\'s attorney general since 2011, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Pruitt spent much of his time in office fighting the Obama administration over the E. P. A. \\'s actions to regulate air and water pollution and to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The committee is led by Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, an outspoken contrarian on climate change, and includes several Republicans openly hostile to federal action to address it. The Democratic members of the committee include some of the Senate\\'s strongest supporters of the E. P. A. and most forceful voices for decisive action on climate change. We asked readers what questions they would ask if they could question Mr. Pruitt. More than 2, 000 replied, and their answers largely fell into a few categories. Here is what some of them would like to know. Many readers seemed familiar with Mr. Pruitt\\'s statement that the science of climate change is \"far from settled. \" Most pointed out that an overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that climate change is happening and is caused by human activity, specifically by the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and asked for Mr. Pruitt\\'s sources for his position. Seth Rudman, 28, a scientific researcher at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, asked, \"Can you describe the shortcomings of the scientific evidence for climate change and the type of data that would be needed to convince you that climate change is happening?\" While being a scientist is not a requirement for the job, readers worried about what having a climate denialist at the top might mean for the agency. \"During the Bush administration, climate scientists, including Dr. James Hansen, claimed that their voices were suppressed and their reports changed to minimize the role of humans in accelerating climate change and its impact,\" wrote Donald Chartier, 60, the founder and chief executive of an internet company in Chicago. \"Can you assure us that E. P. A. scientists will be allowed to present scientific evidence and data freely to the American people, without retaliation?\" Others focused on the risk Mr. Pruitt was taking by denying the risks of climate change. \"If the scientific consensus on climate change proves correct and the changes in the Earth\\'s weather cause widespread devastation, loss of life and property and great economic damage, who should be held responsible for staying the actions that might have prevented or ameliorated these outcomes?\" asked Joseph Griffin, 72, a retiree from Bellefonte, Pa. During his time as attorney general of Oklahoma, Mr. Pruitt has been seen by some to be cozy with the fossil fuel industry. He filed 14 suits against the E. P. A. challenging the agency\\'s environmental regulations, looking to soften the blow of federal policies against oil, gas, agriculture and other interests. In 13 of those cases, companies that had contributed money to Mr. Pruitt or to political campaign committees also signed on. Readers were concerned that Mr. Pruitt might continue to advance the interests of industry, possibly to the detriment of public health and safety. \"How do you intend to serve the public need to protect the environment when you have demonstrated a preference for the rights of corporate shareholders?\" asked Alison ten Cate, 50, an energy efficiency consultant from Belmont, Calif. Others wrote that Mr. Pruitt should be asked if he would be willing to disclose the companies and lobbyists that have given money to his campaigns, and agree to recuse himself from decisions involving them. Mr. Pruitt has argued that states are in a better position to regulate their environment and industries than the federal government, which he has accused of overreach. Many readers argued that air and water do not respect state borders, so it is the federal government\\'s responsibility to regulate these interstate issues. \"You have worked against the E. P. A. in favor of managing interstate and global issues at the state level. Why?\" asked Charles Haddox, 59, a marketing manager in Denver. \"What success stories can you relate in detail showing states are more successful at protecting resources in the absence of federal regulation?\" They also wondered where the limits of Mr. Pruitt\\'s federalism might lie. \"Does your belief in federalism mean you will not interfere with the efforts of California and other states to address climate change?\" wrote Michael McCabe, 19, a student at Sarah Lawrence College. \"Or will you serve the interests of the fossil fuel industry and interfere with states\\' efforts?\" Some asked practical questions, like Mavis 65, a teacher and naturalist in Memphis, who wanted to know how Mr. Pruitt could continue to push for state and local jurisdiction of clean air and water \"in light of the Flint, Mich. water scandal. \" High levels of lead were found in the city\\'s water supply, largely a result of state and local regulatory failures, and the federal government had to intervene (some argue too late). Several readers seemed puzzled at why Mr. Pruitt would want to run a federal regulatory agency if he saw federal regulations as a problem, and wondered if he had other ideas for how to regulate pollutants. Some also would like to hear examples of success on environmental issues from his time in office in Oklahoma. Mark Baker, 48, an American who works for Diageo, an international beverage company, in Brussels, asked, \"Can you provide an example of a policy that originated at the state or local level under your watch in Oklahoma and that resulted in cleaner water or air for Oklahoma\\'s citizens?\" \"Do you believe in protecting water, air and land from pollution?\" wrote Sabina Gasper, 55, who works for the pharmaceutical industry in Bismarck, N. D. \"Do you believe that regulations are the way to do this? If not, how should these resources be protected?\" Some struck a more hopeful tone, like Lilian Howard, \"nearing 80 years of age,\" a retired travel consultant and writer from Virginia Beach, who wrote, \"Would you briefly discuss a few actions by the E. P. A. which you believe were successful in protecting the American people and their natural surroundings from harm and how you might hope we can improve upon these during the new administration?\"',\n",
              " 'STORRS, Conn. â€” One year ago, on the night after Super Bowl Sunday, Geno Auriemma sat alongside three stalwart seniors and momentarily imagined a coaching life without them. \"I start to blink because I look out there and start to think that these three are not going to be there next year,\" Auriemma, coach of the Connecticut women\\'s basketball powerhouse, said after a solid road victory over and South Carolina. He also appeared to be blinking away a tear or two at the thought of losing those three players: Breanna Stewart, Moriah Jefferson and Morgan Tuck. That moment of emotional reflection for Auriemma, who is better known for biting sarcasm, came after a 60th consecutive victory, to which the Huskies predictably added 15 more on the way to their fourth straight (and 11th overall) national championship. Not many, including Auriemma, would have bet the mortgage on the streaks â€” both in games and titles â€” lasting much longer. But on Monday night, in a and expectant Gampel Pavilion, the Huskies made it an even 100 straight victories, swarming that same South Carolina team, to cross the threshold. The Huskies did it behind their forwards, Gabby Williams and Napheesa Collier. Williams scored 26 points and grabbed 14 rebounds while Collier added 18 and 9. \"Continuing what they\\'ve done for so many years,\" said Williams, referring to past iconic Huskies, several of whom, Stewart included, watched from the stands. It starts to sound ridiculous, but the Huskies, this season, have not lost since November 2014 (in overtime at Stanford). If not for that loss, they\\'d be working on a streak of 148 straight. Even Auriemma sounded at a loss to explain this. He settled on \"it was meant to be\" after weeks of insisting that he and his players never talked about No. 100. Against the and No. 6 Gamecocks, the subject was unavoidable. And after 12 successive blowouts in an American Athletic Conference in which the Huskies have gone since its formation, the prospect of stiffer competition was preferable. With an eye on bigger game, the N. C. A. A. tournament, Auriemma said: \"The streak isn\\'t all theirs. They carried the streak across the finish line. But if they win the national championship, it\\'s all theirs. \" It\\'s not as if the act of breaking records is new to his program. A previous record winning streak (surpassing the U. C. L. A. men\\'s record established from 1971 to 1974) was bested by the current run last month. There is no doubt that a potential fifth straight national title, and 12th over all, are numbers more appealing to Auriemma. But triple digits in consecutive wins represents another symbolic groundbreaking and powerful statement in the continued and collective excellence of a women\\'s sports team. Only once had Auriemma\\'s program come this close to 100 â€” a winning streak that stood at 99 when an upstart St. John\\'s team won at Gampel in February 2012, before Connecticut\\'s departure from what was then a highly competitive Big East Conference. \"Senior night, packed house at Gampel, as always,\" Kim Barnes Arico â€” then the St. John\\'s coach, now in her fifth season at Michigan, where she has built a team â€” said in a telephone interview. With St. John\\'s trailing by 2 points in the final seconds, Barnes Arico decided during a timeout to try for the win rather than overtime in such a challenging environment. Shenneika Smith â€” \"she hadn\\'t made a 3 in weeks\" â€” sank the winning shot. On the bus ride home, Barnes Arico\\'s cellphone rang. \"It\\'s Geno, calling to congratulate me after what had to be a crushing loss,\" Barnes Arico said. Auriemma had been supportive of her efforts to elevate the St. John\\'s program, which is why, she said, \"I can\\'t help but applaud what he\\'s doing there, going for 100 straight, just incredible. \" That said, she was \"holding off\" on reaching out, or rooting for either side on Monday, given her ties to South Carolina Coach Dawn Staley. Barnes Arico has coached and U. S. A. Basketball teams with Staley, a Olympian and, like Auriemma, a Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame member. \"Either way, such a great story,\" Barnes Arico said. Staley\\'s team â€” as have most ranked teams â€” presented Connecticut with its usual handicap of a size disadvantage, with their star, A\\'ja Wilson, and the center Alaina Coates. But the Huskies countered with Williams, only and Collier, â€” both quick jumpers who play bigger than they are. After Wilson helped keep the Gamecocks within at the half, the Huskies limited her to 5 points. They took control late in the third quarter and were never threatened in the fourth. \"You can\\'t let your guard down â€” UConn is going to make you pay every time,\" Staley said. In surmounting every obstacle on a schedule with opponents, Auriemma rapidly developed a cohesive Core Four to replace the Big Three of Stewart, Jefferson and Tuck, who were the top three picks in last year\\'s W. N. B. A. draft. \"We have no preseason but we have four really good players, and every time we need something, one of them comes up with something,\" Auriemma said, referring to the juniors Williams and Kia Nurse, and the sophomores Katie Lou Samuelson and Collier. If this wasn\\'t supposed to be a season of extended dominance, the question entering Monday night had evolved. Would the Huskies ever lose? \"It\\'s not if,\" Auriemma said, \"it\\'s just when. \" But if not Monday night, or sometime this season, just when? Next season, Connecticut is planning to suit up Azura Stevens, a transfer from Duke who many believe would have been UConn\\'s best player this season. The Huskies will add Megan Walker, rated by some as the nation\\'s No. 1 high school recruit. They will return six of their seven rotation players, the exception being Saniya Chong, who shares the position with the freshman Crystal Dangerfield.

              " \"I first met Brandon Scott the day after Freddie Gray died. It was April 20, 2015. Mr. Scott, a member of the Baltimore City Council, was quietly observing a news conference where Baltimore police officials announced the suspension of six officers involved in the arrest of Mr. Gray, a black man who sustained a fatal spinal cord injury in a police transport van. In the blighted West Baltimore neighborhood where Mr. Gray grew up, protests were growing. Mr. Gray's death was wrenching for Baltimore a lot has transpired here since then. On the day Mr. Gray was buried, riots broke out, prompting Maryland's governor to call in the National Guard. The fiery state's attorney, Marilyn Mosby, promptly indicted the six officers on charges including murder. The city paid $6. 4 million to the Gray family. With the murder rate soaring, the mayor fired the police chief â€” and decided not to run for office again, as the city struggled to heal. Then came the officers' trials, which ended this week without a single conviction. Throughout, I have repeatedly interviewed Mr. Scott. He is 32, and the vice chairman of the Council committee that oversees the Baltimore police. Before being elected in 2011, he worked in city government and the 300 Men March, an group here. On Thursday, we spoke again, about the latest developments and what has changed. Below is an edited and condensed excerpt from that conversation. Ms. Mosby's team has just accused the Police Department of undermining the prosecution. Does that concern you? My concerns are first and foremost that moving forward, we are doing what we need to do to repair our city â€” to improve relations. I have spent a good deal of time over the last year working on body cameras, working on trainings with young people. The most important thing â€” what gets lost in all of this, is that we are talking about the loss of a life. But I will be following up with the police commissioner, even though this happened before the current commissioner, to provide a response to those claims. You mentioned body cameras. Are the Baltimore police using them? They will, just like in New York or any other major city, they're going to be rolled out. We already have body cameras out there at this point, we are close to 200 officers. Body cameras were in the works before Freddie Gray, but most definitely it ratcheted up the pace. What else has changed? The department decided to improve the vans, so that's a change. And I'm partnering with an organization called Community Mediation, fostering dialogue between youth and the police. Community Mediation is now mediating some internal affairs complaints. A lot of things have changed, things that people don't see because they're behind the scenes. I've talked to a lot of people who feel as though in the end, justice was not served â€” either for Freddie Gray or for the police. What do you say to that? I think what people must know about American justice is that the way the system is set up, you have to have a certain burden of proof and if it's not met, then it's not met. You can be as angry as you want to be, but you have to understand the system and respect it. What about you? Do you personally think justice was served? I can't personalize it. Like myself, what I would do in a situation like that is talk to the family and see how they feel. If Mr. Gray's family feels like everything, from the charges, from the state's attorney proceeding with the trials, everything that has come out of it equals justice to them, then it's justice. That's a careful answer. You've always been so measured in answering my questions. I'm the grandson of poor farmers in rural North Carolina. I truly understand what it means for me being a young black man in this country. But I try not to be divisive, I try not to be polarizing, because that's the last thing we need right now. We have enough of that going on. We've talked about changes in the city. Have you changed? Of course I have changed. I have shifted my work I've tried to do things a little differently. You have to be uncomfortable. If you're not uncomfortable, if you haven't changed the way you operate from April 2015 to now, then you're saying the way our city was, was O. K. â€” and it wasn't. So what are you doing differently? For example today, I'm on the labor committee in the City Council and we voted to send a bill to the full council raising the city's minimum wage to $15 by 2022. I don't think that would have happened before last April. Is Baltimore perhaps a better place now, as a result of Freddie Gray's death? I can say that there have been changes in Baltimore for the better. But I can't say that Baltimore is a complete better place, because we still have a lot of people dying. So Ms. Mosby never got any convictions. What, if anything, did she achieve? Many folks feel that her charging the officers would not have happened under the previous state's attorney. That alone is a big deal for thousands of people in the city. But I would also remember â€” I talked to you and every other media outlet last year, I said, everyone should stay middle ground, because it's just the beginning of the process. Are you surprised at how it turned out? I thought that at least there would be one charge that would stick with at least one officer, but I can't say I'm surprised that it turned out the way that it did.\",\n",

He also notes Power Integrations is expanding its market with DC-to-DC power supply products, and says the firm\\'s growth is based on converting today\\'s power supplies to its more efficient technologies. As a result, the company doesn\\'t need a boost in end-market demand to grow, Lee says.

              " 'Hey Moma Dee, Sorry i haven\\'t been in touch with ya, i have been a little tied up lately. When i got to work today, i decided to email hope and quentin. And after i finished I thought this is something that the whole church might need to hear. So tell me what you think. The last part is ment as The devil\\'s mess took them and God MIGHT place them somewhere else. Okay write back soon. WWJD --------- Inline attachment follows --------- From: To: quentin_da_servant@hotmail.com, HoPeY D.W. Date: Friday, October 12, 2001 1:24:39 GMT Subject: Yall I know yall are tired and need a brake. But I\\'m going to let yall know, while yall are taking that brake, the devil is going to come in on that brake and do his work for you. Hope when i talk to you last, I asked were you going to be at choir rehearsal and you said, \"Why i ain\\'t going to be there Sunday.\" and you are right, but do you have to get all your blessing through the week, and then give him the praise on sunday. You of all people know that you don\\'t need to have a sunday moring experience on sunday, you can have it in a jail tank on tuesday and wendsday. When you are in a relationship, you are going to do all you can to make it work, if you or quentin didn\\'t have ride, why didn\\'t yall ask me, have i ever turned yall down. Make it work. Quentin, where have you been. I am going to real with ya. When you started coming to the church, You and I was thrilled. I was like finaly, i got someone who is on my level who if in case didn\\'t have a right spirit, I could lift up and if i didn\\'t have the right spirit, he could lift me up. I felt that now it\\'s not only me who can get through to these other young men and be there sort of mentor. I have help now, i don\\'t have to be the only one checking on Matthew, Woyne, Damion, Anthony, Marcus, Mann, Kalid, Howard, Devin, and not to mention the girls. Now me and him can be there Accounters, especially for the first four. Well now we don\\'t have to worry about at least one of the the four, Matthew. I\\'m not sure, but he doesn\\'t go to the church anymore, nor his family. And i am not saying it your fault, but you act like if they are not rapping, you don\\'t need to be worried about them, i\\'m being real. I always ask you,\"Q, have you talk to the boys.\" I can\\'t stress this enough, Your presence at the church is greatly missed. And you might say\" well, everybody ain\\'t able to have a nine to five, you got to take what you can get.\" And that is exactly what the devil wants you to feel...Notice I never said your presence on suday morning is greatly missed, i said your presence at the church is. Powertime, Choir Rehearsal, Young adult functions, Afternoon functions, 2nd services, Meetings...You might not see it, but the only God that some of the people might see is through you. You might say, \"Well, if they are going to church just to see me, then they are going for the wrong reason.\" right. But everybody is not on the same spiritual level as us. They are following by example and if they never see you we may never see them. And Hope you already know how we feel about you and the kind of spirit your presence bring. Hope I told you in an email before i went to jail that i almost wanted to give up. And i was still considering it when i typed that. Be careful of what you asked because you just might get it. On that day, I was at work. My supervisor asked me to take some checks down stairs about 4 floors down. I waited for an elevator for a good three minutes, and i figured this was my chance to really talk to God. And i asked hime to give me a renewed spirit, but not all of sudden. Let it be gradually. I promise, when i said a man the elevator opened. Well that evening i went to jail. And it was in that jail tank, God renewed my spirit. Now i can go to choir rehearsal again without thinking about how much i don\\'t like Andrew, I can still go to church even though two vital families aren\\'t there (Davis\\'s and the Abrahams), i can type this letter to yall, and still not worry how yall might see me later. All i am saying is don\\'t wait until you hit rock bottom to be about God\\'s business again. It\\'s Real good that you Believe in God and you read your Bible. Keep in mind that The devil also belives in God and knows the Bible back wards and forwards, He comes to Steal (Davis\\'s and Abrahams) Kill (Our Spirit) and Destroy (Our Church). Please take heed to what I am saying and I am not saying this because I want to get under yalls skin, i am writing it because i am not holding nothing in anymore, because thats what got my spirits down in the first place. And still much luv, You know how we do it. WWJD',\n",
              " 'U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Thursday he would accept the result of the Nov. 8 election - \"if I win\" - fueling Republican concerns his stance would make it harder for his party to maintain control of Congress. His refusal to commit to accepting the election outcome was the standout remark of the third and final 2016 presidential debate between Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton on Wednesday night. It ratcheted up Trump\\'s allegations the election was being rigged against him, and became the latest flashpoint in an unusually acrimonious race three weeks before voters go to the polls. Clinton called the comment \"horrifying.\" President Barack Obama blasted Trump on Thursday at a rally in Miami Gardens, Florida, for Clinton and U.S. Representative Patrick Murphy, who is trying to unseat Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a Trump supporter. \"That is dangerous. Because when you try to sow the seeds of doubt in people\\'s minds about the legitimacy of the elections, that undermines our democracy. Then you\\'re doing the work of our adversaries for them,\" Obama said. Trump modified his comment at a rally in Ohio on Thursday, but did not back off. \"I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States, that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election - if I win,\" he said. He added he would accept \"a clear election result,\" but reserved the right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result. With Trump trailing in opinion polls, the focus ahead of the Nov. 8 vote is shifting to whether Republicans can keep their narrow majority in the Senate or even their larger advantage in the House of Representatives. Senator John McCain of Arizona, who lost the 2008 presidential election to Obama, said accepting the election result was \"the American way.\" \"I didn\\'t like the outcome of the 2008 election. But I had a duty to concede, and I did so without reluctance,\" McCain, who has opened a poll lead in his Senate re-election race, said in a statement. \"A concession isn\\'t just an exercise in graciousness. It is an act of respect for the will of the American people, a respect that is every American leader\\'s first responsibility.\" McCain has withdrawn his support for Trump. Asked on Wednesday night if he would commit to a peaceful transition of power, Trump, a businessman-turned-politician, replied: \"What I\\'m saying is that I will tell you at the time. I\\'ll keep you in suspense. OK?\" Trump\\'s statement, the most provocative in a debate that repeatedly descended into rancor, made headlines across the country and raised questions about his commitment to a peaceful transition of power, a cornerstone of American democracy. Clinton accused Trump of being Russian President Vladimir Putin\\'s puppet. Trump called Clinton a \"nasty woman\" and a criminal who should be barred from running. They did not exchange the customary handshake when the debate ended. On Thursday night the two candidates appeared together at a formal charity dinner in New York and shook hands there after giving speeches intended to roast each other. \"Just before taking the dais, Hillary accidentally bumped into me, and she very civilly said, \\'pardon me,\\'\" Trump joked. \"And I very politely replied, let me talk to you about that after I get into office.\" Trump has said Clinton should be imprisoned for her email practices as secretary of state. Clinton spoke after Trump at the dinner, which she joked was remarkable in itself. \"I didn\\'t think he\\'d be ok with a peaceful transition of power,\" she said. That show of humor was not the norm, however. Democrats jumped to ask Republican candidates whether they agreed with Trump, who is making his first run for public office against Clinton, a former senator and first lady. \"Do you agree with Donald Trump to question the results of the election?\" the Nevada Democratic Party asked in a release targeting Republican Joe Heck. Heck is in a tight race with Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto for retiring Democratic leader Harry Reid\\'s Senate seat. Trump\\'s comments did not worry his supporters. Marion Fields, 48, a registered Democrat who backs Trump, said he did not think concession would be an issue because Trump would win. Were he to lose, \"After it\\'s announced, you\\'d have to be a professional and concede.\" A CNN/ORC snap poll said 52 percent of Americans thought Clinton won the debate, to 39 percent for Trump. Trump donor and energy investor Dan Eberhart said Trump won. He disagreed with his rhetoric, but still backs the candidate. \"I think Hillary\\'s policies and track record are not what the country needs leading us forward for the next four years. And that backs me into supporting Trump,\" Eberhart said. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway sought on Thursday to defend Trump, saying in television interviews he was \"putting people on notice\" about voting irregularities. Trump has not offered specific evidence to back up his vote-rigging claims, and numerous studies have shown that the U.S. election system, which is run by the states, is sound. Trump has stepped up allegations that the election is being rigged against a backdrop of accusations that he had made improper sexual advances to women since a video emerged two weeks ago in which Trump boasted of such behavior. A 10th woman came forward on Thursday at a news conference in Manhattan with attorney Gloria Allred, a Clinton supporter who specializes in representing women in cases of alleged assault. Trump campaign spokeswoman Jessica Ditto called the news conference a \"coordinated, publicity-seeking attack\" by Allred. First lady Michelle Obama, a powerful campaigner for Clinton, renewed her criticism of Trump without naming him during a campaign event in Arizona. \"Decent men do not demean women. And we shouldn\\'t tolerate this behavior from any man, let alone a man who wants to be the president,\" she said.',\n",

              " 'Punto Negro â€“Punto BlancoÂ© May 18, 2016 Yes, Trumpet was right Megyn Kelly is a Bimbo According to an online definition a Bimbo is an attractive but empty-headed young woman, especially one perceived as a willing sex object in other words a slut. If you need help with that definition, you need to stop reading and go back to school. So how did I reach the conclusion you may ask? During the Trumpet run for clown president in January, he wrote: Donald J. Trump âœ”\\u200e@realDonaldTrump \"@gene70: @FireFlyFury @megynkelly @realDonaldTrump And this is the bimbo that\\'s asking presidential questions?pic.twitter.com/oU1uUGnuWb\" 3:36 AM - 28 Jan 2016 Now let\\'s get this straight he called a whore, a slut or as we in the HI Spanic, community would say a puta. (See google on line). I don\\'t know if the woman is married, but if somebody called my wife a bimbo and retweeted it 423 times, he would be looking up from the floor. Being nonviolent a person as I am that is, I am just saying. Women all over America were upset by this degrading term on national media. It is a term that is unacceptable in the workplace and could get an employee fired for using it at work. I know I taught Sexual Harassment classes to over ten thousand public employees. The term is right up there with skank. Men and women alike applauded Kelly for her firm stand against Trump and she was to moderate more of the Fascist News Network debates. Then Trumpet announced that if she was moderating he would not attend. Fox concerned about its ratings and the loss of revenue sat Kelly down and told her to fix this. (See bimbo above network.) She and Trumpet had a one hour private meeting. Want to guess what he told her in that meeting? Note it was her responsibility as the victim to show that it was ok. How did that happen, in case you missed it Kelly did a one on one televised interview, (no pun intended) with Trumpet? The Guardian reported \"He also sought to downplay his embrace of the phrase \"bimbo\" to describe Kelly, suggesting at first that he didn\\'t recall doing so. When Kelly pointed out Trump had on several occasions retweeted followers insulting her as such, he responded: \"Ooo. OK. Did I say that? Excuse me.\" He added: \"Over your life, Megyn, you\\'ve been called a lot worse. It\\'s a modern form of fighting back.\" Kelly said that it was not about her but rather about the message sent to young girls, to which Trump only offered that he would no longer go after her \"because I think I like our relationship right now\". In other words now that you are being a good Fox bimbo and will do what you are told I can talk to you. Note he never said I am sorry, I apologize for calling you a slut. He just said \"Oh did I say that?\" If that was the apology in my world, he would be looking up from the floor. (I am just saying.) Men like him would never work in California state government or private industry unless someone liked paying millions of dollars in court costs and damages. In California, the status of women in the workplace is not the ultimate best but it is getting better. Kelly has proved that she is no model for working women. She is the worst example to our young women who strive to succeed as professionals. Trumpet is a racist sexist thug that is the bottom line. What is to be done? First, Americans have to decide if having a Thug in the white house is a good thing or a bad thing. If they don\\'t care and most of the replicants with few exception are lining up to jump over the cliff. Moreover, republicant voters who vote will vote 95% for the Trumpet that is the hard statiscal fact, simply because they hate the Clintons. Second, the Clintons have to get off their respective culos and start physically campaigning in Latino neighborhoods and spend 50 million dollars on Latino vote by mail and gotv campaigns. Hillary needs real Latino professionals working her campaign. Hillary should also apologize to the women and men of America for Megan Kelly and her lack moral fiber. Then America could take her seriously. She will then be the nominee of the thinking people of America.

              " 'Europe\\'s Battle: Nationalists vs. Elites October 26, 2016  On both sides of the Atlantic, a battle is underway between largely discredited \"elites\" and sometimes disreputable \"nationalists,\" a conflict over un-kept promises about the future and unsettling memories of the past, writes Andrew Spannaus.  By Andrew Spannaus  In recent years \"nationalism\" has become a bad word in Europe, a synonym of closure, racism and wars. Over the past 20-25 years European elites have instead embraced a concept of globalization based on a world without economic, physical and social borders.  This view assumes the gradual affirmation of a set of shared values internationally, consisting of human rights and economic freedom, that however much the remaining closed, autocratic regimes may try, will inevitably become the standard for the entire world. Flag of the European Union.  It is essentially the argument put forward by Francis Fukuyama in \"The End of History:\" liberal democracy and free markets have won the ideological war, and represent the culmination of human evolution.  The political events of 2016 are upending this view of the globalization of human rights and economic liberalism. The American electorate has supported a series of outsiders â€“ most notably Donald Trump, who has run his campaign in direct opposition to the U.S. political and financial class, invoking economic protectionism and a stronger national identity.  Against expectations, the population of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, marking an irreparable break in the supposedly inevitable process of European unification. And across Europe support is growing for more extreme, anti-system political forces, that threaten not only to withdraw from the common currency â€“ the Euro â€“ but also to seal the borders in response to economic and security threats associated with immigration.  Establishment\\'s Failure  It is no exaggeration to speak of the failure of the entire transatlantic political establishment. Since the 1970s, Western economies have undergone a post-industrial transformation that has favored short-term gain over long-term investment. The notion of economic freedom has translated principally into support for deregulation and speculative finance. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is welcomed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the Federal Chancellery in Berlin, Germany, on April 14, 2011. [State Department photo/ Public Domain Central Banks have made unlimited resources available to the financial sector while large areas of the real economy struggle to survive, feeding discontent among the population. It is true that new economic sectors have arisen, along with widespread changes made possible by technologies that were inconceivable until a few years ago, but the overall effect has been to hollow out the middle class and create large-scale income equality. In Europe, the principal vehicle of this process has been the economic policy of the European Union. From the implementation of the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, European nations have been stuck in a monetary straitjacket, that prevents governments from taking effective economic action. In the name of market principles, liberalization has been implemented that favors large financial interests while lowering standards of living for the middle class.  Countries are constitutionally required to move towards a balanced budget, with the European Commission and the European Central Bank essentially having veto power over national policies. This has translated into harsh austerity, including the massive budget cuts and tax increases inflicted on countries such as Greece, Spain and Italy in recent years.  Despite paying lip service to the need for change, the economic and political elites have refused to abandon this approach, that not only ignores the suffering of the population, but actually makes the problem worse. In fact the austerity causes a drop in economy activity and thus exacerbates budget problems, leading to a vicious cycle that Europe seems unable to stop.  A Big Backlash  The resulting backlash is calling into question the process of European integration as a whole, provoking a strenuous defense by the elite of institutions that are said to have guaranteed \"50 years of peace\" after the Second World War. The run-down PIX Theatre sign reads \"Vote Trump\" on Main Street in Sleepy Eye, Minnesota. July 15, 2016. (Photo by Tony Webster Flickr)  It is true, of course, that there are some benefits to E.U. integration, and that nobody wants to return to a situation of conflict among the member states. But the current policies are quite different than the fruitful cooperation that existed until the 1990s, when the financial elite began its move to exert supranational control.  Now, the failed economic policies of the past 20 years are no longer sustainable. Governments are forced to negotiate over .1 percent of the budget deficit with the bureaucracy in Brussels, while the need for public and private investment runs in the trillions.  The pro-finance, anti-production policies must change not for ideological reasons or to serve some specific interest group; they must change because there is no other choice. People are revolting against a political class that does not respond adequately to widespread economic and social discontent. In times of economic distress the population becomes more vulnerable to demagogues, raising the risk of dangerous outcomes, as seen with Fascism and Nazism in the 1920s and 1930s.  Currently, there are unprepared and unpredictable political forces with growing support across Europe, that in some cases represent a threat to the democratic rights and values that the European Union aims to promote. Defending the orthodoxy of E.U. policy against popular movements that target failed economic policies, will only further damage precisely those values on which Europe is said to stand.  What to Do  At this point Europe needs a return to measures that promote productive investment and innovation, rather than cut social welfare programs and encourage further deregulation. Refugees from Mideast wars camped along rail lines in Greece.  There are two potential directions: a wholesale change in the policies of the E.U. institutions, without modifying their essential structure, or a step back from the process of cancellation of national sovereignty.  The first option seems unrealistic, for various reasons. These include the constitutional nature of many economic and budget constraints, and the stubbornness demonstrated by the European ruling class in recent years; a class that, despite numerous alarm bells, does not at all seem ready to abandon an elitist view of globalization.  The response to the Brexit vote is a glaring example. Representatives of the E.U. institutions lashed out with arrogance and bitterness, essentially accusing half of the British population of being ignorant, racist and isolationist. It\\'s a comforting excuse based on partial truths, that avoids reflection on Europe\\'s own mistakes.  At this point a return of decision-making power to national governments is becoming inevitable: not in order to stop international cooperation, or to reject shared values, but because the model pursued by the supranational institutions and their allies in the financial world has failed, and risks producing both serious internal conflicts, and unacceptable strategic failures in an increasingly complex world.

              " 'Donald J. Trump, defending his recent phone call with Taiwan\\'s president, asserted in an interview broadcast on Sunday that the United States was not bound by the One China policy, the diplomatic understanding that underpins America\\'s relationship with its biggest rival. Mr. Trump, speaking on Fox News, said he understood the principle of a single China that includes Taiwan, but declared, \"I don\\'t know why we have to be bound by a One China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade. \" \"I mean, look,\" he continued, \"we\\'re being hurt very badly by China with devaluation with taxing us heavy at the borders when we don\\'t tax them with building a massive fortress in the middle of the South China Sea, which they shouldn\\'t be doing and, frankly, with not helping us at all with North Korea. \" Mr. Trump is not the first incoming Republican president to question the One China policy, but his suggestion that it could be used as a chip to correct Chinese behavior sets him apart, several Asia experts said. While Mr. Trump has been praised by some Republicans for taking a new look at China policy, his stance could risk a backlash by Beijing, the analysts said. Not since 1972, when President Richard M. Nixon and Mao Zedong enshrined the One China principle in the Shanghai CommuniquÃ©, has an American president or so publicly and explicitly questioned the agreement, which resulted in the United States\\' ending its diplomatic recognition of Taiwan in 1979. A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Monday that the government had \"serious concern\" about Mr. Trump\\'s remarks, renewing a debate that erupted nine days ago when he took a congratulatory phone call from President Tsai of Taiwan. At first, Mr. Trump played down the implications of the call, saying he was just being polite. Later, his aides said he was well aware of the diplomatic repercussions of speaking to Taiwan\\'s leader. Lobbyists for Taiwan, including the law firm of former Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, spent months laying the groundwork for the call. On Friday, China\\'s senior foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, met with Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, whom Mr. Trump has designated as his national security adviser, according to a person told about the meeting. It was not clear what the men had discussed. Some Republican foreign policy experts â€” including John R. Bolton, who is believed to be a for the post of deputy secretary of state â€” have praised Mr. Trump for shaking up a diplomatic agreement. As a candidate, Ronald Reagan criticized the decision to abrogate recognition of Taiwan after his election, he invited a delegation from Taiwan to attend his inauguration, antagonizing Beijing. In 1982, as president, Reagan pushed for the Six Assurances, one of which was a reaffirmation that the United States did not formally recognize Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan. Still, he abided by the terms of the 1979 joint communiquÃ© that established relations between the United States and China. But Mr. Trump\\'s suggestion that the policy could be wielded as a chip in a broader negotiation with China has implications not just for Washington\\'s relationship with Beijing, several experts on Asia said, but also for America\\'s support for Taiwan. \"By putting One China up for grabs, Trump will suck all the oxygen out of the U. S. relationship, and it risks eventually trading away U. S. support for Taiwan for another U. S. interest,\" said Evan Medeiros, a former senior director for Asia at the National Security Council. \"There are good reasons why eight presidents since 1972 have relied on the One China policy,\" he added. \"This is one area where the Trump team would do well to heed the lessons of history instead of bucking them in the uncertain hope of getting something. \" Jeffrey A. Bader, Mr. Medeiros\\'s predecessor in the Obama administration, said the One China policy had \"always been seen as a foundation of the relationship. \" \"Now Trump apparently sees it as part of a broader set of new transactions,\" he said. \"Mixing trade with an issue seen by Beijing as involving sovereignty is likely to produce an angry Chinese backlash and worsen both issues. \" An editorial on Monday in The Global Times, a Chinese tabloid, said that Mr. Trump was \"like a child in his ignorance of foreign policy. \" \"The One China policy cannot be bought and sold,\" the editorial said. \"Trump, it seems, only understands business and believes that everything has a price. \" Mr. Trump, however, did not appear worried about inflaming Beijing. He repeated in the Fox News interview many of the criticisms he has made about China, emphasizing what he said was its unwillingness to help curb the nuclear ambitions of its neighbor North Korea â€” an issue that foreign policy experts believe could confront Mr. Trump as the first geopolitical crisis of his presidency. The said he would not tolerate having the Chinese government dictate whether he could take a call from the president of Taiwan. He reiterated that he had not placed the call, and described it as \"a very short call saying, \\'Congratulations, sir, on the victory. \\'\" The Chinese government, which once viewed Mr. Trump favorably as an alternative to the hawkish Hillary Clinton, has struggled to respond to Mr. Trump\\'s unorthodox approach. China\\'s foreign minister, Wang Yi, initially played down the significance of the phone call, calling it a \"petty action by the Taiwan side\" that he said would not upset the longstanding policy of One China. But as Mr. Trump has repeated his campaign criticisms of China â€” and as his statements about Taiwan have rippled throughout the region â€” Beijing has noticeably hardened its tone. It warned him last week, in a editorial in the overseas edition of People\\'s Daily, that \"creating troubles for the . S. relationship is creating troubles for the U. S. itself. \" In a pointed rejoinder to Mr. Trump, the editorial said that pushing China on Taiwan \"would greatly reduce the chance to achieve the goal of making America great again. \"',\n",
              " 'The Senate approved complex health care legislation on Wednesday that would increase funding for disease research, address weaknesses in the nation\\'s mental health systems and vastly alter the regulatory system for drugs and medical devices. The vote sealed a final legislative victory for President Obama, who strongly supported the bill against objections from many liberal Democrats and consumer groups. In many ways the bill, known as the 21st Century Cures Act, is a return to a more classic approach to legislation, with policy victories and some disappointments for both parties, and potential benefits for nearly every American whose life has been touched by illness, drug addiction and mental health issues. Years in the making, the measure passed 94 to 5 after being overwhelmingly approved by the House last week. One major winner â€” and a donor to both parties â€” was the pharmaceutical industry its role set off fierce but futile opposition by Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts. On many of the areas addressed by the bill, pharmaceutical companies were in step with the interests of patients desperate for cures, an unusual and emotionally charged alliance between an industry and its consumers. The bill was a test of Ms. Warren\\'s muscle, exercised from the far left of the Senate Democratic caucus, and it is one that did not go well. \"I will fight it,\" she said of the bill last week on the Senate floor, \"because I know the difference between compromise and extortion. \" In the end, however, not a single member of her home state, which has many medical research centers joined her. Nor did anyone else apart from three other senators â€” Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, both of Oregon â€” and Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah. The measure would benefit people with mental illness and chronic diseases, biomedical researchers, pregnant women, hospitals, children with diabetes, people addicted to opioid drugs, children who are bullied, and those who are gravely ill. \"I doubt that there is a family in America who will not be touched by this important legislation,\" said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. In a statement issued after the Senate vote, Mr. Obama said, \"The Cures Act makes important investments that will save lives. \" \"This is a reminder of what we can do when we look out for one another,\" the president said. \"Like Joe Biden and so many other Americans, I\\'ve lost people I love deeply to cancer. I\\'ve heard often from those whose loved ones are suffering from Alzheimer\\'s, addiction and other debilitating diseases. Their heartbreak is real, and so we have a responsibility to respond with real solutions. This bill will make a big difference, and I look forward to signing it as soon as it reaches my desk. \" Mr. Obama has noted that the bill includes money to combat the opioid epidemic, to advance his Precision Medicine Initiative, which aims to collect genetic data on one million American volunteers so scientists can develop treatments, and to support Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \\'s \"moonshot\" to cure cancer. Mr. Biden â€” whose son, Beau, died of a brain tumor last year â€” presided on a procedural vote to move the bill forward in the Senate Monday night, a moving moment for most members of the Senate. While Republicans and Democrats often fight over government spending, the bill benefited from its largess to one agency that has broad support, the National Institutes of Health. \"I don\\'t think there is enough money that we can put into the N. I. H. ,\" said Representative Steve Cohen, Democrat of Tennessee, \"because it is important and it affects all Americans independent of political party, race, sexual orientation â€” you name it. \" The bill gives the health institutes the authority to finance research using special procurement procedures, as opposed to more conventional grants and contracts. It also requires the agency\\'s director to establish \"Eureka prize\" competitions to advance biomedical research and improve treatments for serious illnesses. The bill raises the status of mental health issues by creating a new assistant secretary for mental health and substance use, to be appointed by the president. It directs federal agencies to step up enforcement of laws that require equal insurance coverage for mental and physical illnesses. Federal laws and rules requiring mental health parity have been adopted with bipartisan support over the last 20 years, but a White House task force found recently that compliance was lagging. \"We didn\\'t get everything we needed,\\'\" said Representative Tim Murphy, Republican of Pennsylvania, the architect of provisions to improve the treatment of mental illness, \"but we needed everything we got. \" Major provisions of the bill push the Food and Drug Administration to speed the review and approval of drugs and medical devices. Kim Monk of Capital Alpha Partners, a policy research firm for investors, described the bill as \"a holiday win for much of the health sector. \" Scott Whitaker, president and chief executive of the Advanced Medical Technology Association, a trade group for device makers, hailed the bill for creating \"an expedited pathway for breakthrough medical technologies â€” those that offer the best hope for patients with diseases\" and few treatment options. In reviewing new devices, the bill says, the F. D. A. shall consider the \"least burdensome\" means of showing their safety. In considering whether to approve new drugs or new uses for medications, the bill says, the F. D. A. shall pay more attention to \"patient experience data\" showing the impact of a disease or treatment on patients\\' lives, and their treatment preferences. The legislation does not include provisions to rein in prescription drug prices, a significant victory for the pharmaceutical industry. Consultants to the industry said that drug makers had kept a low profile in their lobbying on the legislation, knowing that any conversations on Capitol Hill could turn quickly to drug prices. \"When the cost of our prescription drugs is skyrocketing, this bill does nothing to combat excessive prices,\" said Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the senior Democrat on the Appropriations subcommittee on health and human services. She voted against the measure. \"While the bill authorizes $4. 8 billion to the N. I. H. over the next 10 years â€” on average, a mere $480 million a year â€” this is barely a quarter per year of what the House passed last year,\" Ms. DeLauro said. \"There is also no guarantee that the appropriators will follow through and provide funding each year. \" Representative Kathy Castor, Democrat of Florida, who voted for the bill, said she too wished that more of the money had been guaranteed. \"Medical research in America today should not be subject to the whims of congressional budget battles or political fights,\" she said.',\n",
              " 'The Clinton campaign reacted with yet another ad featuring Trump\\'s own words this time disparaging veterans and their families. The anti-Trump Priorities USA SuperPAC went even further with a new spot that shows Trump saying, \"I love war.\" Trump\\'s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway responded by saying the bizarre comment was taken out of context but the full quote, which he gave last November at a wild Fort Dodge, Iowa, rally (the same one where he called Ben Carson a child molester), is even worse than what it sounds like in the ad: Trump has never been in the service, although he has said,\"I always felt I was in the military\" because of his education at a military-themed boarding school and he believes he has \"more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military.\" That comment \"I\\'m good at war\" says everything about Trump as he demonstrated last night at the town hall forum that he is indeed unfit to be president of the United States. There were many aspects of his performance that had people gasping at the mere idea of this man in a position of real power, not the least of which was his comment that President Barack Obama compares unfavorably to Russian President Vladimir Putin who \"has an 85 percent approval rating\" and is \"very much a leader\" because he has \"strong control over his country.\" But it was around the question of ISIS and the Middle East where he really showed his true colors. He was upset that Hillary Clinton had earlier claimed that he had lied when he said he had been against the Iraq War and defended himself by pointing to an Esquire magazine article from 2004 â€” which doesn\\'t really help since the war began in the spring of 2003. The fact-checkers have declared his pants are on fire numerous times on this but he just keeps saying it. Last night he also made a passing reference to someone \"asking him about Iraq\" 14 years ago, and you may be surprised to learn that at that same crazy Iowa rally he told the crowd that a delegation from the White House came to him to ask his opinion and he advised not to go in because it would destabilize the region. To the best of my knowledge this claim has never been validated. It\\'s possible, of course, this was the Bush administration. But let\\'s just say that it\\'s as likely as Trump\\'s witnessing thousands of New Jersey Muslims cheering after 9/11. You\\'ll knock the hell out of one and the other one is going to come and take over the other. You don\\'t have to be a genius to figure this out even though I am a genius. And by the way, I\\'m more militaristic than anybody in this room. I\\'m going to make our military so strong, so powerful. Everyone seems to think that Trump has \"pivoted\" from his position that he could not reveal his plan to defeat ISIS to his announcement today that he would give the generals 30 days from the inauguration to come up with one. But that\\'s wrong. Trump\\'s secret plan is not so secret. At that same rally last fall, Trump spoke about it plainly: \"I know more about ISIS than the generals do. Believe me. . . . I would bomb the shit out of \\'em. . . . I\\'d blow up the pipes. I\\'d blow up the â€” I\\'d blow up every single inch. There would be nothing left. And you know what, you get Exxon to come in there and in two months â€” you ever see these guys how good they are? The great oil companies? They\\'ll rebuild that sucker brand-new. It\\'ll be beautiful. And I\\'d bring it, and I\\'d take the oil.\" At the forum, he reiterated this belief that America should \"take the oil\" because he thinks this will make ISIS surrender and has taken to saying \"to the victor goes the spoils\" apparently unaware that this is a considered a war crime. He has said in the past it would require a permanent force to protect the oil but that it wouldn\\'t take much. Trump said that under Obama and Clinton\\'s leadership \"the generals have been reduced to rubble\" and \"reduced to a point where it\\'s embarrassing for our country.\" He sounded as if he planned to fire some of them, which isn\\'t actually something the president can do. As he is wont to do he brought up his favorite, General George Patton, saying that he\\'s \"spinning in his grave\" over the state of affairs in the military. The good news is that he didn\\'t bring up General Black Jack Pershing and endorse mass executions with bullets dipped in pigs\\' blood as he often does on the trail. He maintained that he still believes in his own plan for Iraq and says he won\\'t necessarily follow the generals\\' advice. So, the GOP nominee for commander in chief tells people that he\\'s \"good at war,\" \"has had a lot of wars of his own\" and \"loves war in a certain way\" despite never having been in the military. He also believes he\\'s a \"genius\" who is \"more militaristic\" than anyone in the room. His plan to defeat ISIS is to blow up the Iraqi oil wells and have Exxon come in and rebuild them. And he believes that half the military leadership are fools and thinks he can just fire the ones he doesn\\'t like. But there\\'s nothing delusional about any of that so there\\'s no need to concern yourselves that the poll numbers are tightening. If he happens to pull this off, what could go wrong?',\n",
              " 'Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here\\'s the .) Let\\'s turn it over to Jennifer Medina, a correspondent based in Los Angeles, for today\\'s introduction. Another day, another example of California\\'s continued fight with the Trump administration. The State Senate overwhelmingly approved legislation Monday that essentially turns California into a \"sanctuary state\" for undocumented immigrants. The bill expands protections for immigrants at a time when the Trump administration has expanded who is considered a priority for deportation. The legislation prohibits any state or local law enforcement agency from using resources to investigate, detain, report or arrest people for immigration violations. Under the legislation, county jails would not be able to allow officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to work inside the jails or notify them when a prisoner is being released. After the bill came under fierce criticism from the California State Sheriffs\\' Association, it was amended to allow local law enforcement officials to notify ICE of the release date of serious and violent felons. It also enables local law enforcement officers to alert federal officials if they come across someone who has a violent felony record and has been previously deported. Language in the bill was also changed to explicitly allow local agencies to participate in task forces even if they include immigration enforcement in investigations. The amendments did little to mollify the opposition. One Republican senator warned that the Legislature would be \"kicking the president right in the groin,\" with the law and warned that \"he will strike back. \" After the vote, Kevin de LeÃ³n, the leader of the state Senate and sponsor of the bill, said, \"Our communities will become more, not less, dangerous if local police are enlisted to enforce federal immigration laws. \" He called the passage of the bill a \"rejection of President Trump\\'s false and cynical portrayal of undocumented immigrants as a lawless community. \" Just before the Senate passed the sanctuary state bill, lawmakers approved legislation to start a fund that would pay for lawyers for undocumented immigrants facing deportation. Several Republicans spoke out against the legislation, saying it was an unfair use of taxpayer money and also contradicted the idea that the state wants to stay out of immigration enforcement. Both bills will now move to the Assembly. Gov. Jerry Brown has not indicated whether he would sign either one.

Others suspend themselves high above the Pacific\\'s crashing waves on a narrow strip of nylon known as a slackline. Billy Rudiger, a reader in Carmel, shared a photo he captured of a slackliner traversing a cove just south of Monterey last November. Rope walking has existed for centuries. But the origins of the modern slackline, flat webbing strung loose enough to bounce like a trampoline, usually between two trees, is traced to Yosemite rock climbers in the early 1980s. It quickly grew into a sport. In the last five or so years, social media has helped to propel its popularity. The pinnacle of the sport is a variation known as highlining, meaning the line is affixed at height. Highliners wear tethers, though a small number of elite practitioners sometimes go without. Injuries can happen, but they are usually of the sprained ankle variety and involve lines a few feet off the ground, said Sonya Iverson, president of Slackline U. S. a group that promotes the sport. \"We aren\\'t daredevils or \" she said. Slackliners talk about the practice as a metaphor for the art of living â€” \"balancing everything on the line to demonstrate life\\'s possibilities,\" as the famed climber and highliner Dean Potter put it. For Ryan Robinson, 34, the highliner in Mr. Rudiger\\'s photo, the blue ocean juxtaposed against the jagged rocks represented a cathedral of sorts. \"It\\'s such a beautiful place,\" he said. \"It\\'s nice to pay respect in a very unique way. \" California Today goes live at 6 a. m.

              " 'As the Islamic State seeks to export its brand of barbaric terror to would-be affiliates, the U.S. faces a growing challenge to find the sources of ISIS funding and blunt its flow to allied militants. The terror army\\'s most recent atrocity was the mass beheading of 21 Coptic Christians in Libya. It remains unclear how closely tied those militants are to ISIS in Iraq and Syria, but the Islamic State\\'s underground economy continues to thrive. Even as the U.S.-led coalition strikes at what was long the heart of ISIS\\' revenue stream -- oil fields and refineries -- officials say the terror network is making money in other ways. \"We know that oil revenue is no longer the lead source of their income in dollars,\" Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said recently. But he added: \"They get a lot of donations. They also have a significant black market program.\" How much money ISIS truly makes from donations is a matter of debate. But experts agree that ISIS receives significant revenue from black-market smuggling and other operations. \"ISIS is selling anything they can get their hands on,\" Dr. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said in an interview with Fox News. Plus, according to reports, the group is even skimming Iraqi taxpayer dollars by shaking down government employees in areas they\\'ve conquered. In short, ISIS is set on building a terror empire, going so far as to tout its annual financials. Reportedly, ISIS released a $2 billion budget for 2015 including a $250 million surplus, though those numbers are disputed. After Mosul fell to the Islamic State in June, the International Business Times declared ISIS the \"world\\'s richest terrorist organization\" after the central bank\\'s vaults were looted of some $420 million. Estimates vary, but ISIS reportedly rakes in between one and three million dollars per day, though the strikes against its oil refineries have taken a toll. The United Nations last Thursday tried to strike at the money stream. The Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution aimed at cutting off millions of dollars in earnings from oil smuggling, antiquities trafficking and ransom payments to ISIS. The measure calls for sanctions against individuals and entities that trade in oil with ISIS and Al Qaeda affiliates such as the Al-Nusra Front in Syria. The resolution was co-sponsored by more than 35 countries. It called for all 193 countries of the U.N. to take steps to prevent ancient artifacts from being smuggled and sold and to ban the direct or indirect sale of ransoms. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said payments and donations to ISIS \"perpetuate a cycle of horrific brutality, giving these groups resources to carry out more murderous acts and incentivizing them to take more people captive.\" How much ISIS really receives from donations is unclear. \"Most charities [supporting radical Islam] in the Gulf are aligned with Al Qaeda, not ISIS,\" said Gartenstein-Ross. Gartenstein-Ross pointed to Abdulrahman al-Nuaymi, a Qatari who has been accused by the U.S. Treasury Department of transferring millions of dollars to Al Qaeda affiliates in Iraq and Syria, as a prime example of this arrangement. While many blame Qatar for playing a \"double game\" of supporting both radical Islamist groups and the coalition against ISIS, the Obama administration disputes the notion that wealthy Arabs from Persian Gulf countries give generously to ISIS. \"ISIL derives a relatively small share of its funds from deep-pocket donors, and thus does not, today, depend principally on moving money across international borders. Instead, ISIL obtains the vast majority of its revenues through local criminal and terrorist activities,\" said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen in October, at The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"There is a lot of opacity,\" Gartenstein-Ross admitted. But he said the smuggling of black market goods, similar to the opium trade by the Taliban inside Afghanistan; taxation among the Iraqi population particularly in Mosul; and the sale of oil round out other areas of ISIS funding. Gartenstein-Ross pointed out that airstrikes from the U.S.-led coalition against oil refineries in Syria have denied ISIS a large source of revenue. Looting and ransoms make up for some of the difference, however. Some experts point to the Iraqi government as unwittingly contributing to ISIS\\' coffers. Aki Peritz, a former CIA counterterrorism analyst, said in a recent New York Times op-ed that the Iraqi government continues to pay its civil servants in Mosul, despite being controlled by ISIS. Peritz wrote, \"Baghdad provides about $130 million every month to pay all its workers in Mosul\" and estimated that Iraq\\'s treasury has paid over $1 billion to these civil servants since Mosul fell in June 2014. He estimated that ISIS has taken half of those payments in the form of taxation. While efforts are currently underway to dismantle key revenue sources for the Islamic State, there are signs the caliphate is receiving setbacks from within. According to syriadirect.org, \"Assassinations, bombings and defections plague the Islamic State in Deir e-Zor,\" in oil-rich eastern Syria. The nonprofit news outlet based in Amman, Jordan, says that over the past month, assassination attempts against members of ISIS religious police have become more common.

VIDEO \"I do think it is important for us to understand the nature of the threat; what works and what doesn\\'t. Painting the Muslim community with a broad brush does not work. They are the greatest allies in fighting against the organizations...Most importantly, we have to stay true to our values during the process. We have to make sure that we are not engaging in the kind of the knee-jerk anti-Muslim sentiment that we have heard from some politicians. We have to make sure that the legal structures around our intelligence gathering and our use of predators are subject to oversight. It is not always going to be easy. It is not always going to be perfectly smooth. There are going to be times where as president you make a decision knowing that there are going to be critics, and knowing that there\\'s some gray areas, and ambiguities that you have to deal with given the realities of the situation, but overall, I think that we can draw a lesson from the Bin Laden raid that we have got really effective people and a government that knows how to do this. As long as we operate from the position of confidence and strength and are true to who we are, groups like this or the individuals like this cannot defeat us.\" President Obama is correct. Success in combating terror requires strong relationships with our Muslim allies in the Middle East and Muslims in the United States who are often the first line of defense against terror attacks. In fact, taking out Osama Bin Laden depended on those relationships with Muslims in Afghanistan and Pakistan who provided intelligence to U.S. officials. The President\\'s comments put Dangerous Donald Trump\\'s lack of judgment in context, including his absurd proposal to ban an entire religion from the United States, along with his and other half-baked proposals and foreign policy cluelessness, has that have alarmed our allies throughout the world - including leaders in the Middle East who are our partners in fighting terror. They\\'re also a reminder that Ted Cruz has been just as disconnected from reality in his calls has called for \"carpet bombing\" the Middle East Syria and Iraq with no regard to civilian lives, and would force law enforcement to \"patrol and secure\" neighborhoods where Muslim-Americans live, a dangerous and discriminatory policy that resembles the political witch hunts of the McCarthy era would only make our communities less safe.

              " 'Dear Tim, Thanks very much for your email. I greatly appreciate the additional information that you\\'ve given me. I am a bit conflicted about what we should do. IJC published a paper with egregious statistical errors. Douglass et al. was essentially a commentary on work by myself and colleagues - work that had been previously published in Science in 2005 and in Chapter 5 of the first U.S. CCSP Report in 2006. To my knowledge, none of the authors or co-authors of the Santer et al. Science paper or of CCSP 1.1 Chapter 5 were used as reviewers of Douglass et al. I am assuming that, when he submitted his paper to IJC, Douglass specifically requested that certain scientists should be excluded from the review process. Such an approach is not defensible for a paper which is largely a comment on previously-published work. It would be fair and reasonable to give IJC the opportunity to \"set the record straight\", and correct the harm they have done by publication of Douglass et al. I use the word \"harm\" advisedly. The author and coauthors of the Douglass et al. IJC paper are using this paper to argue that \"Nature, not CO2, rules the climate\", and that the findings of Douglass et al. invalidate the \"discernible human influence\" conclusions of previous national and international scientific assessments. Quick publication of a response to Douglass et al. in IJC would go some way towards setting the record straight. I am troubled, however, by the very real possibility that Douglass et al. will have the last word on this subject. In my opinion (based on many years of interaction with these guys), neither Douglass, Christy or Singer are capable of admitting that their paper contained serious scientific errors. Their \"last word\" will be an attempt to obfuscate rather than illuminate. They are not interested in improving our scientific understanding of the nature and causes of recent changes in atmospheric temperature. They are solely interested in advancing their own agendas. It is telling and troubling that Douglass et al. ignored radiosonde data showing substantial warming of the tropical troposphere - data that were in accord with model results - even though such data were in their possession. Such behaviour constitutes intellectual dishonesty. I strongly believe that leaving these guys the last word is inherently unfair. If IJC are interested in publishing our contribution, I believe it\\'s fair to ask for the following: 1) Our paper should be regarded as an independent contribution, not as a comment on Douglass et al. This seems reasonable given i) The substantial amount of new work that we have done; and ii) The fact that the Douglass et al. paper was not regarded as a comment on Santer et al. (2005), or on Chapter 5 of the 2006 CCSP Report - even though Douglass et al. clearly WAS a comment on these two publications. 2) If IJC agrees to 1), then Douglass et al. should have the opportunity to respond to our contribution, and we should be given the chance to reply. Any response and reply should be published side-by-side, in the same issue of IJC. I\\'d be grateful if you and Phil could provide me with some guidance on 1) and 2), and on whether you think we should submit to IJC. Feel free to forward my email to Glenn McGregor.

              " 'In 2012, the movie phenomenon \"The Avengers\" filled theaters across the globe. Commercials, product advertisements, and billboards plastered with this ragtag team of superheroes who somehow forge a relationship to help save humanity from certain destruction at the hands of an evil villain was a fan favorite. The Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America, Hawkeye, and Scarlet leaped into action after being convinced by the military genius Mr. Furry. They were able to put aside their differences and work for the greater good. In the end, the world is safe. In the first two weeks, the film raked in over $215 million and instantly confirming the superhero concept of \"The Avengers\" was not so new, in fact, it is sometimes a very common occurrence. During this election season, more than just the presidency is at stake. Although crime, division, malice and wrongdoing seems to be ever-present, instead of wallowing in discouragement voters need to exercise the right to become an avenger in a world of evildoers. After the computer generated images, million dollar budgets and Hollywood star power are stripped away, an Avenger is simply an individual who takes up the cause of another who is unable to protect himself or herself. In different circles, that person may be referred to as an advocate. At the core of humanity, people should make a choice to operate by the infamous Golden Rule, which is \"Treat others the way you want to be treated.\" By the looks of American culture, it seems many have strayed far away from this simple principle. Society has always been balanced by persons stepping up to the plate to champion causes bigger than themselves. These everyday avengers have come in the form of presidents willing to abolish slavery, pilots flying beyond enemy lines, ministers willing to lock arms and protest on behalf of others for equal rights and even voters who go to the polls to make their voice heard. Society has been privileged to experience them come from diverse backgrounds, ethnicities, and cultures all with the same selfless spirit. They may not have worn a cape but were viewed as \"super\" just the same. During this heated election season, voters possess that same heroic power. In the midst of all the confusion screaming across the fabric of today\\'s society, many would love to function as an avenger but are not sure how. Here are a few places modern-day Avengers have the ability to cast a vote in a world of evil and take action: In the area of women\\'s rights It is not uncommon to see the face of a woman plastered on the cover of business magazines as top CEOs and other company leaders. However, in the broader scope of the country, there are still great strides needed to bring equality across genders. In the United States, women still earn dramatically less than their male counterparts do in Corporate America. First Lady Michelle Obama championed equal pay for equal work on the campaign trail and now organizations such as the National Organization for Women remain on the front line of this issue fighting to make sure the progress achieved in the last sixty years is not in vain. Without the vote, progress does not happen. Better education in underserved communities Civil Rights leader and advocate Malcolm X once said, \"Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today.\" This concept has been the foundation for public education in America. The right to receive adequate training to be a productive and prosperous American is the right of every person. Therefore, it is amazing to see certain communities with gross neglect and weak curriculums. These areas lack a voice to speak on their behalf. It is encouraging to see leadership like the Gary Comer College Prep School that shines as a beacon in the Chicago area. Amidst killing and senseless loss of life, this school boasts an excellent attrition rate for high school seniors accepted into college. Better healthcare for all people The country is in the middle of a tug of war. Unfortunately, what is at stake is far greater than bragging rights. The health and welfare of seniors and children hang in the balance of those on Capitol Hill. Whether Obamacare is right or wrong is not as important as the need for dialogue around this issue. On one hand, there are elderly who are struggling with the decision to purchase food or their prescriptions and on the other, there are parents who cannot receive proper care at neighborhood clinics. Parents should not have to wonder if their doctor could afford to keep his doors open when he is the only office in the community. There is an initiative to bring mobile clinics to the heart of areas needing it the most. Armed with immunizations, screening, and dental supplies, they are giving away services free that otherwise would not even happen. The moral of Becoming an Avenger No one promises a cape or a billboard, but everyone has a super ability to step in and relieve the sufferings of others. All it takes to be a real-life Avenger is the choice to fight for the needs of the less fortunate; those without a voice or an advocate. In November do not sit idly by, vote to become an avenger in a world seemingly overtaken by evildoers. Not only does this produce a sense of fulfillment and greatness, it also provides the opportunity to be remembered as a modern-day Avenger. These are only a few of many opportunities for activism, but there are many ways to become an active participant in the goal for change. It may seem small and uneventful, but the vote has a unique power to affect the Oval Office more than Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. For those who have not been privileged to cast an early ballot, pause for the cause and vote, vote, vote on November 8.

              " 'The presidents of the United States and Mexico spoke by phone on Friday after relations between the neighboring countries frayed further over Donald Trump\\'s border wall plan, with the U.S. leader calling the talk friendly but still demanding reworked trade and other ties. The call between Trump and Enrique Pena Nieto came a day after the Mexican president scrapped a meeting set for next week at the White House over Trump\\'s demand that Mexico pay for a multibillion-dollar wall along the lengthy southern U.S. border with Mexico. Mexico insists it will not pay for it. Both countries issued statements saying Trump and Pena Nieto recognized their clear differences of opinion on the payment demand, and agreed to settle the matter as part of a broader discussion on all aspects of the two nations\\' relationship. Financial markets took news of the call as a sign that the crisis in U.S-Mexican relations just days after Trump took office had eased. Mexico\\'s peso rose on the news. Mexico\\'s government statement said Trump and Pena Nieto agreed not to talk publicly for now about payment for the wall. The White House did not immediately clarify whether Trump had agreed not to publicly discuss how the wall would be paid for. During a joint news conference at the White House with visiting British Prime Minister Theresa May after the call, Trump did not mention the wall even as he spoke expansively about U.S. relations with Mexico. \"As you know, Mexico - with the United States - has out-negotiated us and beat us to a pulp through our past leaders. They\\'ve made us look foolish,\" Trump told the news conference. \"We have a trade deficit of $60 billion with Mexico. On top of that, the border is soft and weak, drugs are pouring in,\" added Trump, who during the U.S. presidential campaign accused Mexico of sending rapists and other criminals into the United States. The United States had a $58.8 billion trade deficit with its southern neighbor in the 11 months ending last November. Trump called his hour long talk with Pena Nieto \"very, very friendly,\" said he has a \"very good relationship\" with him and expressed \"great respect for Mexico.\" Mexico and the White House both called the meeting productive and constructive. Nevertheless, Trump showed no signs of backing off pledges to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico and Canada and slap high tariffs on American companies that have moved jobs south of the border. Mexico sends 80 percent of its exports to the United States, and about half of Mexico\\'s foreign direct investment over the past two decades has come from its northern neighbor. \"We are going to be working on a fair relationship and a new relationship\" with Mexico, Trump told the news conference with May. \"But the United States cannot continue to lose vast amounts of business, vast amounts of companies and millions and millions of people losing their jobs. That won\\'t happen with me.\" Trump said the United States will renegotiate trade deals and other aspects of America\\'s relationship with Mexico, adding, \"And in the end I think it will be good for both countries.\" U.S. congressional leaders said on Thursday they would take up legislation to provide $12 billion to $15 billion to pay for the wall. Trump, who has insisted that Mexico will reimburse the United States for the entire cost, signed a directive on Wednesday for the wall to proceed, part of a package of measures aimed at curbing illegal immigration. The wall plan has angered Mexicans, and Trump\\'s policies toward Mexico have put Pena Nieto on the defensive. The Republican president views the wall, a major promise during his election campaign, as part of a package of measures to curb illegal immigration. Mexico has long insisted it will not heed Trump\\'s demands to pay for the construction project. On Thursday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer sent the Mexican peso falling when he told reporters that Trump wanted a 20 percent tax on Mexican imports to pay for the wall. Spicer gave few details, but his comments resembled an existing idea, known as a border adjustment tax, that the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives is considering as part of a broad tax overhaul. Trump said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network on Friday that there were options besides an import tax that could be \"much more positive\" for both countries. The White House said Friday\\'s call also covered \"the importance of the friendship between the two nations, and the need for the two nations to work together to stop drug cartels, drug trafficking and illegal guns and arms sales.\" Mexico\\'s government said the U.S. trade deficit also came up. In Mexico City, billionaire Mexican businessman Carlos Slim said a united Mexico was ready to help the government negotiate with Trump and called on all political parties to support Pena Nieto in his discussions with the U.S. president. In a rare news conference by the generally media-shy mogul, Slim said Mexico needed to negotiate from a position of strength, noting that Trump, who he called a \"great negotiator,\" represented a major change in how politics will be conducted.',\n",

              " 'First published October 31, 2016  Iraq is going to invade and destroy Saudi Arabia. They would have done it back in 1990 except for waffling by George H.W. Bush who had initially authorized the move and then rescinded approval, according to statements made by former Congressman Ron Paul, based on WikiLeaks State Department hacks.  Saddam was blocked in 1990, and that may well have been a huge mistake on the part of everyone involved. When the US returned in 2003, it was Saudi cash that financed the Sunni Wahhabist was against the coalition government in Baghdad, a war that continues to this day, with the same cast of characters, the same Saudi cash, but they now call it \"ISIS.\"  5000 Americans died fighting Saudi paid jihadists.  Saudi Arabia has always known that Iraq has only allowed them to continue their mischief so long as they served a purpose. When the war with Iran ended in 1988, that purpose had ended also.  Saudi mischief in Iraq, playing tribe against tribe, pushing for Kurdish separatism and partnering with Israeli intelligence, ramped up as America scaled back her military presence under President Obama.  By 2014, a logistics and command structure to destroy both Syria and Iraq had been established, headquartered in the Saudi embassies in Beirut and Amman and operating military operations centers, designed and built by the Israelis, at key locations in Turkey and quickly bolstered by satellite facilities across Iraq and Syria. The Saudi\\'s were feeling time getting away from them, their decades of military buildup, based on endless oil and investment performance, no long sustainable. They had to knock out Syria and Iraq, using Israel, Turkey and NATO as surrogates, push the US into destroying Iran and cleanse Yemen of threats.  They bribed everyone they got near. Were the Saudi\\'s really the ones behind the Arab spring? Do we see the hands of Saudi Arabia when Israel channels Hamas fighters into the Yarmouk Camp, outside Damascus, to bolster ISIS forces? These are the telling events few see, but that prove the hypothesis and provide what is needed to predict a future that may well no longer include the Dark Kingdom.  With a world obsessed with Islamic extremism and terror threats, why is no one looking at where it comes from, who finances, whose ideas are behind it and who it serves? With fingers pointing at the Mossad or CIA and so many others, the real issue is Wahhabism and the real root of it all is Saudi Arabia.  There is no version of 9/11 that doesn\\'t credit Saudi Mohammed Atta as planner of 9/11, whether assisted by Israeli art students or Osama bin Laden, depending on which theories you follow. The Saudi\\'s did it and American civil courts are busy now assessing the damages.  Oil money and sovereign immunity and, oh yes, control of the UN Human Rights Council, from which Russia was just expelled, protect them also, despite their abuses and love of head chopping. Pro-Iran militias in Iraq  What is playing out now will lead only one direction , to a stronger Iraq, one under Shiite control with the economically powerful Sunni families, quietly migrating to their second homes in Dubai and Qatar.  The crippled military the US saddled Iraq with will be gone, replaced by powerful Iranian-trained militias.  The American-trained army joined ISIS. Had Prime Minister Maliki, back in 2014, been more aware of the threat, he would have moved against the Army. That, however, would have renewed the civil war, a war that could only have been ended with Iranian military intervention and Iran was still reeling with sanctions and the threat of American invasion.  That threat is gone also. That world is gone, or soon will be as is being played out in Mosul and Aleppo. No one would have imagined Baghdad\\'s resolve or the partnership between Russia and Iran. Still in question is Turkey\\'s role. It is clear someone promised them Aleppo and Mosul, as is reflected in their military incursions into Syria and Iraq.  If Saudi Arabia thinks Turkey will lift a hand to block Iraq\\'s wrath, they are delusional. Turkey knows it can have peace with Iran and that both share similar ideas about the Kurds. This far outweighs any Turkish ambitions to the South. Turkey may well be planning a new Ottoman Empire, but Saudi Arabia is not in the cards for Turkish occupation. Members of the Abbas combat squad, a Shia militia, trained with Iraqi soldiers in Basra  This leaves the protection of the United States and the upcoming election. Is there any American political leader that would oppose Iraq were they to hit Saudi Arabia, by 2020 or 2021?  The prediction is that Iraq will come out of this war intact and, if they do, with a victorious army for the first time genuinely answerable to Baghdad and reeling from the battle of Mosul, likely to leave 20,000 civilians dead in its wake or more, the national enmity for Saudi Arabia will know no bounds.  The Sunni gangsters from Anbar that aligned with the Saudis are mostly dead, many beheaded by ISIS. The promised Kurdish state in Erbil, the so-called \"Barzani Sultanate\" will not be handed control of the massive Kirkuk oil fields and the Ceyhan Pipeline by ISIS, as may well have been planned.  Without these assets, Erbil will still enjoy a strong commercial presence but will never be able to reach into the Kurdish diaspora and bring the millions home and under questionable rule, subject to Erbil\\'s deal making with everyone. Eventually Erbil will become a ghost town, the sons that returned will again migrate and Turkish ambitions, seemingly undone, will be fulfilled.  As it appears now, Iraq will survive. Iraq also knows that what Saudi Arabia tried twice, they will try again and that the only way Iraq can be free is if Saudi Arabia falls.  And then there is Iran. Iranian aircraft have carried out strikes against the Islamic State.

              " 'Print  The deliberations of the Constitutional Convention of 1787 were held in strict secrecy. Citizens gathered outside Independence Hall in Philadelphia during the proceedings, attempting to learn what sort of government had been agreed upon behind closed doors. As he exited the Hall, a woman asked Benjamin Franklin, \"Well, Doctor, what have we got a republic or a monarchy?\"  Franklin responded, \"A republic, if you can keep it.\"  It\\'s important to note that Franklin did not include the word democracy because the difference between a republic and a democracy is fundamental. The word republic comes from the Romans\\' word in Latin res publica â€” which means \"the public thing.\" \"Democracy,\" on the other hand, invented by the Greeks, comes from their words demos and kratein , which means \"the peoples\\' rule.\" Greek democracy meant majority rule. Yet, even during its first few decades of existence, the great Greek thinkers such as Plato and Aristotle rejected democracy as a bad form of governance, labeling it \"mob rule.\"  So we can confer on Franklin\\'s response to that inquiring woman that he believed, in the wake of Britain\\'s capitulation to Washington\\'s revolutionary army, the Continental Congress had created a constitutional republic fashioned much more closely to the Roman representative Republic than the Athenian Democracy.  But now, 230 years later, we must countenance the specter of a woman who has trafficked in national security secrets and is guilty of numerous felonies becoming the president of the United States. This has made me wondering if it might not be possible for the House of Representatives to begin impeachment proceedings against a President Clinton shortly after her election. So I resolved to contact various members of Congress to ask them if they wouldn\\'t attempt impeachment as a means to fulfill their oaths of office to preserve and protect the constitution.  I first made contact with Congressman Tom McClintock of the 4 th District of Northern California. What follows is our interview:  Kelley: Do you agree with my contention that a Hillary presidency would mean that we would be a post constitutional republic?  McClintock: I\\'m afraid we may already have entered the post-constitutional phase of American history. The fundamental architecture of the American Republic â€“ the separation of powers and the Bill of Rights â€“ is already breaking down. The question now is whether we will enter the restoration period or the decline period of our free government. I think a Hillary Clinton presidency has the potential of taking us past a tipping point that makes restoration of the Constitution much more difficult and unlikely.  K: What do you think the ramifications of her election would be?  If the current justices all serve until their actuarial age, the next President will make four appointments to the Supreme Court. Clinton and Justice Ginsburg have made it very clear that once a lock-step leftist majority is cemented into that court, their first two objectives are reversing Citizens United and Heller, which would have dire implications to our First and Second Amendment rights. I would expect that due process protections will begin falling quickly thereafter to enable, among other things, the prosecution of dissenters from leftist global warming orthodoxy. And even if the election of 2020 produced a Republican president with overwhelming Republican congressional majorities, any serious reform legislation could be expected to be struck down by a court whose majority will view its role as policy-making rather than upholding the Constitution. I could add the catastrophic impact of her \"open borders\" program that has devastated Europe and her intention to further increase taxes and regulatory burdens that could deal a knock-out blow to our faltering economy.  K: What do you think the likelihood would be of her immediate impeachment?  M: Zero. Impeachment requires 2/3 of the Senate, which would be a political impossibility.  K: If it cannot remove a known felonious president who, as Secretary of State, compromised national security, has Congress lost its power to be a check on the executive branch?  M: The Constitution was written to be self-enforcing. But that only works as long as its powers are evenly divided; which, in turn, only works if the officials who exercise its powers are obedient to that Constitution; which, in turn, only works if \"we, the people,\" through our votes, insist on it. When we stop insisting on it, we forfeit our Constitution and the freedoms it protects. Lincoln was right: \"If destruction be our lot, we must, ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of free men, we are destined to live for all time, or die by suicide.\"  K: But even if there were no chance she could be removed, wouldn\\'t simply the filing of impeachment articles be a historic way for those who wish to remain obedient to the Constitution to voice a powerful rejection of her lawlessness?  M: Larry, you\\'re dreaming. There\\'s no do-over for this election. (End of Interview).  As a nation, we\\'ve had a pretty good two-hundred-year run. But as Ben Franklin warned and Congressman McClintock fears, we may now have not kept or constitutional republic.  Article reposted with permission from LarryKelley.com shares',\n",

Of course, conservative media is gloating about this by claiming that the newspaper is broke and will be laying off hundreds of employees. But it appears that the New York Times is simply restructuring and the moves will only affect a handful of jobs for the time being if any at all. Meanwhile, the publisher and CEO are giving up corner offices, which will save more money to keep more employees. So the plan is displacing everyone on those floors no matter what position they hold in the company.And so Sarah Palin decided to brag about the New York Times supposedly going broke (citing a right-wing website that profits on fake news and can t even bother to check their headlines for typos) by posting about it on Twitter, massacring lyrics from a popular Jamie Foxx and Kanye West song from 2005 in the process.NYT: I ain t saying you a golddigger, but there s a reason you messin with broke, broke, broke. https://t.co/PYkWNyyx9k Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) December 19, 2016Seriously, that does not make any sense.

              " 'The virtual currency Bitcoin has been swept up in yet another speculative frenzy, pushing its price toward the peak it last reached in late 2013. The price of Bitcoin has been buoyed by increased interest from places like Venezuela, where the local currency has lost much of its value, and India, where the government recently removed the largest cash notes from circulation. More broadly, a tilt toward isolationism that has emerged in American and European politics â€” highlighted by Donald J. Trump\\'s election victory â€” has given a new sheen to a currency that can move between countries with little oversight. \"The more there is an expectation for new barriers to be erected, the more there is an expectation that Bitcoin will be valuable for moving money across borders,\" said Gil Luria, the director of research at Wedbush Securities. Still, most of the people actually buying and selling Bitcoin these days are coming from a single country: China. Some wealthy Chinese have used Bitcoin to evade their government\\'s strict controls on moving money in and out of the country, according to Bitcoin specialists in China. But the heavy trading on Chinese Bitcoin exchanges, much of it by automated software, suggests that most of the price movement is a result of bets by speculators. In recent days, the price of a Bitcoin has been about 3 percent higher on these exchanges than on dollar denominated exchanges, suggesting more demand in China than outside. The importance of speculators suggests that the value of Bitcoin is still driven by the hope of how it might be used someday, rather than real world use today, which has generally been hard to quantify. In dollar terms, a Bitcoin was going for about $1, 025 on Tuesday, or about 140 percent more than what it cost at the beginning of 2016. The volatile price has led many analysts to conclude that is less similar to a currency than to a commodity, like gold, which has a value resulting from its scarcity. In Bitcoin\\'s case, the rules of the network dictate that only 21 million Bitcoin will ever be created. The recent rise has brought the price of one Bitcoin to within striking distance of the price of an ounce of gold, which was about $1, 150 on Monday. The price has increased in the last year despite the lack of interest in Bitcoin from banks and a majority of more sophisticated investors. After showing early interest in the currency, most big banks have moved on to make investments in the blockchain, the new type of ledger technology introduced by Bitcoin, while eschewing Bitcoin itself. Some central banks have talked about issuing their own national currencies on some sort of blockchain inspired by but unrelated to the blockchain that Bitcoin uses. Bitcoin and the blockchain were introduced in late 2008 by a mysterious coder who used the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Anyone with a computer and internet access can open a Bitcoin wallet and help maintain the blockchain ledger where all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. Because it is run by a decentralized network of computers around the world, Bitcoin does not require a central authority like a central bank or financial institution. That has made it attractive to people who hope to do financial transactions anonymously, such as the drug dealers who have sold illicit goods for Bitcoin on the Silk Road website and its successors. New Bitcoins are released at regular intervals to computers helping to support the Bitcoin network, and previously released Bitcoins can be bought and sold on exchanges around the world. Since 2009, the price of Bitcoin has generally been defined by long periods of stability marked by short periods of speculative excitement. The only other time the price of Bitcoin has exceeded $1, 000 was in late 2013, when the demand was driven by a surge of interest from Chinese investors and traders. The price soon crashed when one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, Mt. Gox, which was based in Tokyo and went bankrupt, announced that it had lost most of the Bitcoins held by its customers (the cause remains in dispute). The Bitcoin price fell to its low â€” under $200 â€” in early 2015. Since then, the price has risen in fits and starts, in part because of continuing hacking and fraud, and because of fights over the direction of the Bitcoin network. Many Bitcoin businesses have wanted to edit the basic Bitcoin software to change the number of transactions that can move through the network every day. But the proposed changes have run into opposition from the team of coders responsible for maintaining the basic Bitcoin software. Many Chinese Bitcoin companies have sided with the coders. That disagreement has led to slowdowns on the Bitcoin network, with some transactions taking days to be processed. The slowdowns have made it harder to use Bitcoin for everyday payments. But through the controversy the security of the basic Bitcoin wallets and transaction software has held up, making it a potential alternative for people in countries with less secure currencies and financial institutions. In November, interest in Bitcoin spiked in India after the government announced moves to quickly ban the largest Indian bank notes, in an effort to crack down on corruption. The continued fall in the value of the Venezuelan currency, the bolÃ­var, has led to reports about Venezuelans desperate to exchange their money for Bitcoin. But despite the new demand, the total value of all outstanding Bitcoin, about $16 billion, is still only that of a American company, and is not large enough to sustain the demand of even a moderate number of Indians or Venezuelans looking to store their wealth in the virtual currency. That points back to the importance of speculators, who are betting that someday soon people worldwide will turn to Bitcoin for their daily financial needs, and push the price much higher. \"I ascribe only 10 percent of the value of Bitcoin to current day usage, and more like 90 percent of it to the expectation of future usage,\" Mr. Luria of Webush Securities said.',\n",

              " 'U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Sunday it was time for Iranian-backed militias and their Iranian advisers who helped Iraq defeat Islamic State to go home , after a rare joint meeting with the leaders of Iraq and Saudi Arabia. The United States is concerned that Iran, a Shi ite regional power, will take advantage of gains against IS in Iraq and Syria to expand the influence it gained after the U.S. invasion in 2003, something Sunni Arab rivals such as Riyadh also oppose. Iranian militias that are in Iraq, now that the fight against Daesh and ISIS is coming to a close, those militias need to go home. The foreign fighters in Iraq need to go home and allow the Iraqi people to regain control, Tillerson said at a joint news conference with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Jubeir. Tens of thousands of Iraqis heeded a call to arms in 2014 after IS seized a third of the country s territory, forming the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), which receive funding and training from Tehran and have been declared part of the Iraqi security apparatus. A senior U.S. official said Tillerson had been referring to the PMF and the Quds Force, the foreign paramilitary and espionage arm of the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif berated Tillerson s remarks as influenced by Iran s oil-rich regional rival Saudi Arabia. Exactly what country is it that Iraqis who rose up to defend their homes against ISIS return to?, Zarif said in a tweet. Shameful US FP (foreign policy), dictated by petrodollars. Iraq s military, armed by the United States but supported by the PMF, ejected the ultra-hardline Sunni Muslim militant group from Mosul and other cities in northern Iraq this year. Several thousand U.S. troops are still in the country, mostly for training but also to carry out raids against IS. The campaign to uproot the militants left whole cities in ruins and has hit Iraq s economy. A new joint ministerial-level body between Iraq and Saudi Arabia convened its inaugural meeting earlier on Sunday to coordinate their fight against IS and on rebuilding Iraqi territory wrested from the group. Jubeir emphasized historic ties between the two neighbors, which share a border, vast oil resources and many of the same tribes. The natural tendency of the two countries and people is to be very close to each other as they have been for centuries. It was interrupted for a number of decades. We re trying now to make up for lost ground, he said. The rare senior meeting, signaling a thaw between states that have been at loggerheads for decades, was also attended by Saudi King Salman and Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. Tillerson said the council would contribute to reforms to build Iraq s private sector and encourage foreign investment. This will be critical to winning the peace that has been earned through the hard-fought military gains, he said. State media said the council had expressed satisfaction with global oil markets recovery as a result of a deal with other countries to boost prices by limiting production. The council also agreed to reopen a Saudi Basic Industries Corp office in Iraq and grant Saudi agriculture company SALIC an investment license. A second meeting will be held in Baghdad but no date was mentioned. Saudi Commerce and Investment Minister Majid al-Qusaibi told Reuters his country seeks to boost exports and is eyeing investment opportunities in Iraq s agricultural and petrochemical sectors, among others. He said backing from the highest levels of both governments would produce quick results on the ground . Let s not cry over spilt milk. Whatever happened in the past has happened. The good news is we are all here toward building a prosperous and beneficial future for both countries, he said in a telephone interview. Tillerson and Jubeir also discussed Washington s hawkish new policy towards Iran, including a possible withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal and new sanctions on the IRGC. Both our countries believe those who conduct business with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, any of their entities, European companies or other companies around the world really do so at great risk, Tillerson said. Relations between Riyadh and Baghdad were cut for 25 years, before recent rapprochement, after former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990. Saudi Arabia, along with the United Arab Emirates, is wooing Baghdad now in an effort to halt the growing regional influence of Iran. Arriving in Doha later on Sunday for the next leg of a multi-country trip, Tillerson told a news conference that there was little chance of a swift breakthrough to resolve a blockade imposed on Qatar by Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies. The kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain imposed trade and travel curbs on Doha in June for alleged support of terrorism and friendship with Iran - charges Qatar denies. There is not a strong indication that the parties are ready to talk yet, Tillerson said. The secretary of state s six-day trip will also take him to Pakistan, India and Switzerland.',\n",

              " \"A North Korean state agency threatened on Thursday to use nuclear weapons to sink Japan and reduce the United States to ashes and darkness for supporting a U.N. Security Council resolution and sanctions over its latest nuclear test. The Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee, which handles the North s external ties and propaganda, also called for the breakup of the Security Council, which it called a tool of evil made up of money-bribed countries that move at the order of the United States. The four islands of the archipelago should be sunken into the sea by the nuclear bomb of Juche. Japan is no longer needed to exist near us, the committee said in a statement carried by the North s official KCNA news agency. Juche is the North s ruling ideology that mixes Marxism and an extreme form of go-it-alone nationalism preached by state founder Kim Il Sung, the grandfather of the current leader, Kim Jong Un. Regional tension has risen markedly since the reclusive North conducted its sixth, and by far its most powerful, nuclear test on Sept. 3, following a series of missile tests, including one that flew over Japan. The 15-member Security Council voted unanimously on a U.S.-drafted resolution and a new round of sanctions on Monday in response, banning North Korea s textile exports that are the second largest only to coal and mineral, and capping fuel supplies. The North reacted to the latest action by the Security Council, which had the backing of veto-holding China and Russia, by reiterating threats to destroy the United States, Japan and South Korea. Let s reduce the U.S. mainland into ashes and darkness. Let s vent our spite with mobilization of all retaliation means which have been prepared till now, the statement said. Japan s Nikkei stock index and dollar/yen currency pared gains, although traders said that was more because of several Chinese economic indicators released on Thursday rather than a reaction to the North s latest statement. South Korea s won also edged down around the same time over domestic financial concerns. Despite the North s threats, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said he was against having nuclear weapons in his country, either by developing its own arsenal or bringing back U.S. tactical nuclear weapons that were withdrawn in the early 1990s. To respond to North Korea by having our own nuclear weapons will not maintain peace on the Korean peninsula and could lead to a nuclear arms race in northeast Asia, Moon said in an interview with CNN. South Korea s Unification Ministry also said it planned to provide $8 million through the U.N. World Food Programme and UNICEF to help infants and pregnant women in the North. The move marks Seoul s first humanitarian assistance for the North since its fourth nuclear test in January 2016 and is based on a longstanding policy of separating humanitarian aid from politics, the ministry said. The North s latest threats also singled out Japan for dancing to the tune of the United States, saying it should never be pardoned for not offering a sincere apology for its never-to-be-condoned crimes against our people , an apparent reference to Japan s wartime aggression. It also referred to South Korea as traitors and dogs of the United States. Japan criticized the North s statement harshly. This announcement is extremely provocative and egregious. It is something that markedly heightens regional tension and is absolutely unacceptable, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, visiting India, called for strict enforcement of the U.N. resolution, saying the world must force a change. The 15-member Security Council voted unanimously on a U.S.-drafted resolution and a new round of sanctions against North Korea on Monday in response to its latest and most powerful test, banning North Korea s textile exports that are the second largest only to coal and mineral, and capping fuel supplies. North Korea had already rejected the Security Council resolution, vowing to press ahead with its nuclear and missile programs. A tougher initial U.S. draft of Monday s resolution was weakened to win the support of China, the North s lone major ally, and Russia. Significantly, it stopped short of imposing a full embargo on oil exports to North Korea, most of which come from China. The latest sanctions also make it illegal for foreign firms to form commercial joint ventures with North Korean entities. U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed that North Korea will never be allowed to threaten the United States with a nuclear-tipped missile, but has also asked China to do more to rein in its neighbor. China in turn favors an international response to the problem. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the international community had reached a high consensus on trying to realize a peaceful solution. We urge the relevant directly involved parties to seize the opportunity and have the political nerve to make the correct political choice as soon as possible, Hua told a regular press briefing. The North accuses the United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, of planning to invade and regularly threatens to destroy it and its Asian allies. The United States and South Korea are technically still at war with North Korea because the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce and not a peace treaty.

              " 'A citizen\\'s complaint accusing Gov. Chris Christie of official misconduct in the closing of traffic lanes at the George Washington Bridge in 2013 can proceed, a municipal court judge in New Jersey ruled on Thursday, raising the possibility that Mr. Christie could face a criminal indictment. The judge, Roy F. McGeady of Bergen County, found that there was probable cause to believe the governor had engaged in official misconduct in connection with the lane closings, as claimed in a complaint filed in September by William J. Brennan of Wayne. As a result of Judge McGeady\\'s ruling, the Bergen County prosecutor\\'s office must now decide whether to seek an indictment against Mr. Christie. The unexpected development, which unfolded in a courtroom that typically deals with relatively minor crimes, is the latest problem for Mr. Christie, a Republican, related to the lane closings. In his complaint, Mr. Brennan, a retired firefighter with a history of filing lawsuits against government agencies, accuses Mr. Christie of failing to order subordinates to reopen access lanes to the bridge in Fort Lee on Sept. 11, 2013, the third consecutive day the lanes had been closed. The lane closings, which paralyzed traffic in the town, erupted into a scandal that helped derail Mr. Christie\\'s presidential ambitions and led to federal charges against three of his allies. Federal prosecutors say the closings were meant to punish Fort Lee\\'s mayor, a Democrat, for declining to endorse Mr. Christie for . Two of those allies are now on trial in federal court in Newark, accused of authorizing the closings and trying to cover up the true reason for them the third has pleaded guilty to his role in the closings and is the prosecution\\'s main witness. In his complaint, Mr. Brennan writes that the mayor, Mark J. Sokolich, and Fort Lee residents were deprived of \"the benefit and enjoyment of their community as a consequence of this intentional act. \" Mr. Brennan, 50, said in an interview on Thursday that he had been moved to file the complaint after a particular day of testimony in the federal trial. He said the basis for his complaint emerged when David Wildstein, who has pleaded guilty to orchestrating the scheme, testified that Mr. Christie was told about the closings during a ceremony to mark the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Mr. Brennan said he was in the federal courthouse listening to Mr. Wildstein testify and later obtained a transcript of his testimony to submit along with his complaint. \"Here you have a prime example of the government turning its power against the citizens, and that is the definition of totalitarianism,\" Mr. Brennan said. In New Jersey, a citizen is entitled to file a criminal complaint, which is then assessed by a judge who determines whether there is enough evidence, or probable cause, to issue a summons. If a judge fails to find probable cause, the complaint is dismissed. Citizen complaints are relatively common in New Jersey\\'s municipal courts, said J. C. Lore III, director of trial advocacy at Rutgers Law School. \"It\\'s usually reserved for more petty disputes, between family or neighbors,\" Mr. Lore said. Many such cases are resolved through mediation at the behest of the court, he said. Still, 13, 550 citizen complaints involving indictable offenses were filed in New Jersey\\'s municipal courts in 2015, and 87 percent yielded findings of probable cause, according to data provided by a court spokeswoman. Brian T. Murray, a spokesman for Mr. Christie, called Mr. Brennan\\'s complaint \"dishonorable\" and accused him of being a \"serial complainant and political activist with a history of abusing the judicial system. \" \"The simple fact is the governor had no knowledge of the lane realignments either before they happened or while they were happening,\" said Mr. Murray, who added that the governor\\'s lawyers planned to appeal the ruling. \"This matter has already been thoroughly investigated by three separate independent investigations. \" In a letter sent to Judge McGeady before he ruled on the complaint, Mr. Christie\\'s lawyers argued strenuously that Mr. Brennan had not met the probable cause threshold, calling his complaint \"rife with distortions. \" Mr. Brennan\\'s litigation history dates to 1996, when he sued the township of Teaneck, claiming he had been harassed for speaking out about safety issues, according The Record, a northern New Jersey newspaper. A jury awarded him nearly $900, 000, though a judge later reduced the amount significantly. Mr. Brennan said he earned a law degree after retiring from the Teaneck Fire Department. According to New Jersey law, obtaining a conviction of official misconduct against Mr. Christie would require proof that he deliberately refrained \"from performing a duty which is imposed upon him by law or is clearly inherent in the nature of his office,\" in order to benefit himself or harm someone else. Such a conviction would carry a potential prison sentence of five to 10 years. Maureen Parenta, a spokeswoman for the Bergen County prosecutor\\'s office, declined to comment about whether it would pursue an indictment. Gurbir S. Grewal, the acting prosecutor, was appointed by Mr. Christie.',\n",
              " 'Mayor Bill de Blasio posted a video on his City Hall Twitter account on Tuesday that featured two Broadway actors singing his praises and promoting his accomplishments, drawing criticism from government watchdog groups who said that it was an inappropriate use of public money and was too much like a campaign ad. The video, which tries to poke fun at itself even as it promotes the mayor, was posted on the official City Hall Twitter account, @NYCMayor, and features Mr. de Blasio in an awkward thespian effort. It also includes his wife, Chirlane McCray a senior adviser, Andrea Hagelgans and two Broadway stars, Jenna Ushkowitz and James Monroe Iglehart. Ms. Ushkowitz starred in the television show \"Glee\" and has appeared in Broadway musicals, including \"Waitress\" and \"Spring Awakening. \" Mr. Iglehart won a Tony Award in 2014 for his role as the Genie in \"Aladdin. \" The video shows Mr. de Blasio, who is running for in the coming year, sitting in the back of what appears to be one of the mayoral sport utility vehicles, talking with Ms. McCray on his cellphone. \"Hey honey, I really like this song idea,\" he says. \"I really think it\\'s the perfect way to wrap up all the great things we\\'ve done this year. \" Ms. McCray, Ms. Hagelgans and the actors are shown in a room at Gracie Mansion. Ms. McCray puts the mayor on speaker phone so he can listen as the two actors sing, accompanied by a piano player. \"In case the folks are unaware, we\\'ve got some facts we\\'d like to share,\" they sing. They go on to plug mayoral programs like protections for renters, the construction and preservation of affordable housing, and a mental health initiative. \"Who\\'s bringing cops and community close?\" Ms. Ushkowitz sings as the beat goes . \"Who\\'s got incarceration and crime rates sinking to a record low?\" The performance closes with a rousing reference to Mr. de Blasio. \"No matter what will be, we\\'ve got Billy D. B. !\" Ms. Ushkowitz belts out. The mayor starts out nodding happily to all the praise but then whispers to an aide, \"This is kind of over the top. \" In the end, he delivers his review of the performance: \"Maybe the song\\'s a little too elaborate,\" he says. \"Maybe we should just do a couple of tweets and a Facebook post instead. \" Dick Dadey, the executive director of Citizens Union, a government watchdog organization, questioned whether creating the video was a justifiable use of public resources and said it raised questions because it came right before next year\\'s campaign. \"This is a virtual campaign ad that is meant to be a announcement but goes beyond that in serving to promote the mayor,\" Mr. Dadey said. The video is part of a broader effort by City Hall to increase its use of the internet and social media to reach out to New Yorkers directly, bypassing traditional news media. It also comes as Mr. de Blasio controls his interactions with the press, frequently avoiding questions and limiting the news conferences at which he will take questions on any topic to once a week. Eric Phillips, Mr. de Blasio\\'s press secretary, said that the video was produced by City Hall staff and that the actors volunteered their time. Mr. Phillips said that City Hall spent a total of $700 to pay the piano player and a composer. He said it cost an additional $170 to have the piano tuned and $30 to rent a rehearsal room. Although the mayor is running for next year, Mr. Phillips said in a written statement that the video \"doesn\\'t have anything to do with his campaign. \" He added, \"We think New Yorkers have a right to know what their government does, and it\\'s our job to communicate that work in a modern way. \" The immediate effect of the video was not exactly the stuff of Broadway hit material. In the first seven hours after the video was posted on Twitter, it had received 218 likes on the mayor\\'s account and 88 retweets.',\n",
              " '\"Unbelievable\", \"embarrassing\" even \"dangerous\" are some of the words the financial elite gathered at the World Economic Forum conference in the Swiss resort of Davos have been using to describe U.S. Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump. Although some said they still expected his campaign to founder before his party picks its nominee for the November election many said it was no longer unthinkable that he could be the Republican candidate. Some noted that whatever the outcome, a heated campaign, which has also seen self-proclaimed Socialist Bernie Sanders provide a tough challenge to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, could alter the U.S. political environment, giving vent to new populist anger on both sides of the political divide. Trump\\'s nationalist rhetoric, particularly proposals to ban Muslims from entering the United States, tax goods made abroad and build a wall on the Mexican border, were never the sort of thing to appeal to the free trade crowd that typically gathers at events like the annual Davos economic forum. \"Clearly it is not a rhetoric that is inviting for integration,\" said Chile\\'s Finance Minister, Rodrigo Valdes, referring to his comments on the campaign trail. \"In Chile we have a deep view that integration of the Americas is a good thing, whether it is goods, financing and yes people. So I\\'d be happier with a more welcoming rhetoric.\" Among the present and former government officials in the Swiss resort was Eric Cantor, former Republican majority leader in the U.S. House of Representatives, now vice-chairman of Moelis & Co, an investment bank. Like much of the Republican party\\'s establishment, he had cold words for Trump. \"He\\'s not serious. He\\'s amazing at promoting his personal brand and reflecting an underlying anger at home,\" Cantor said. \"Trump Fever is an unsustainable phenomenon that will not translate into a victory for the candidate.\" But for Ray Nolte, chief investment officer of Skybridge Capital, a $13 billion hedge fund whose founder has supported other Republican candidates including Jeb Bush, such establishment pronouncements sound like wishful thinking. \"Is Donald going to be the nominee? I don\\'t know. It\\'s sure looking that way now,\" Nolte said. \"Anyone here (at Davos) who is in the mainstream says there is no way he could possibly get the nomination. When I hear that, it probably means it is going to happen.\" Noting the challenge to Clinton from Sanders, which he said could pull her to the left on issues like financial regulation, Nolte said institutional investors were already paying attention to the prospect of increased U.S. political volatility from the election. Arianna Huffington, whose Huffington Post news website once insisted on covering Trump, a former reality TV star, as an entertainment figure rather than a politician, said the site reversed its policy once he announced his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States, which made him too \"dangerous\" to ignore. \"I feel the mainstreaming of Donald Trump, instead of him being treated as an extreme, dangerous candidate, is really the most troubling aspect of American politics right now,\" she said. \"He\\'s being interviewed on all the main shows, and he\\'s being asked questions about what his first State of the Union address would be like if he wins, instead of actually being forced to answer the tough questions about his policy, especially his policy of wanting to ban Muslims from entering the U.S., which is so dangerous, so un-American and should really be the center of the coverage of Trump.\" For Dominic Barton, global managing director for business consultancy McKinsey, Trump has turned the political campaign itself into \"entertainment\", which could hurt the global image of the United States. \"It\\'s a bit embarrassing globally. But I think there\\'s a big difference between the rhetoric and the reality, and I think most people will see that and discount it. But it\\'s incredible how long its been going for. It\\'s just unbelievable,\" he said. But not everyone is worried. Sandeep Dadlani, executive vice president of Indian outsourcing firm Infosys, said his firm has earned the majority of its revenue in the United States for more than 30 years. \"We have seen many elections come and go. It is common in all election seasons for rhetoric and extreme personalities to shine. Inevitably we have found governments from both sides to eventually come up with sensible policies,\" he said.

              " 'Americans in liberal enclaves from New York to San Francisco reacted with shock and despair on Wednesday to Republican businessman Donald Trump\\'s defeat of Democrat Hillary Clinton, with many struggling to explain the result to their children. Trump, who had never before run for public office, won on a broad wave of support both from the Republican U.S. heartland and by flipping previously Democratic states, including Pennsylvania, Florida and Ohio, helping his party protect majorities in both chambers of Congress. The victory stunned residents of major cities up and down the East and West coasts, many of whom had trusted opinion polls that had long predicted a Clinton victory but were proven profoundly wrong by Tuesday\\'s results. \"I\\'m feeling physical pain. I\\'m shocked. I\\'m sad,\" said Sofia Huizar, 30, as she waited outside the Manhattan hotel where Clinton conceded her loss on Wednesday morning, some eight hours after Trump declared victory. Huizar, a U.S. citizen who was born in Mexico, said she spent much of Tuesday night commiserating with family across the border. \"It\\'s a way to help process the fear,\" Huizar said. Trump\\'s campaign promises have included building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to stop illegal crossings and to deport the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States. Others, like Kim Priban, a 38-year-old nurse who lives in the Cleveland suburb of Boston Heights, Ohio, said they had a difficult time breaking the news to their children. Priban said she had proudly taken her 5-year-old daughter along to vote for Clinton, who would have been the first woman U.S. president, and on Wednesday morning had to discuss the result with her. \"I still haven\\'t quite figured out what to tell my daughter. I\\'ve been crying all day,\" Priban said. \"I feel like I have to go out and make my voice heard for women and children.\" Priban and Huizar are likely far from alone in the depth of their pain over Clinton\\'s loss, academic research suggests. A 2015 paper by researchers at Harvard University found that voters who supported Republican Mitt Romney\\'s unsuccessful White House bid reported sharper spikes in their unhappiness than parents following the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre of Connecticut schoolchildren or Boston residents after the deadly 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. While many Democrats along the coasts mourned Clinton\\'s defeat, Trump supporters celebrated the outcome, saying they hoped he would shake up a dysfunctional political system. \"The overwhelming majority of Americans want change, and this is a direct result. ... Trump is the disrupter, for better or for worse,\" said Kelley Smith, 33, who lives in Chicago and works in software sales. \"He\\'s a little bombastic. I don\\'t think he\\'s polished. But I don\\'t think he\\'s going to purposefully take our country down.\" The divide between the coasts and the heartland, evident not only in the results but also in the social media battles ahead of the election, made the Trump victory more shocking for liberals. Deena Pioli, an attorney from San Francisco, said she had rarely run into people who were not supporting Clinton, and that she now regrets that. \"Those of us here in San Francisco and California should not be so safe in our bubble,\" she said. Trump dropped his angry speaking style to take a conciliatory tone when he declared victory early Wednesday morning, saying, \"I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans.\" Clinton and Democratic President Barack Obama sounded similarly restrained. But the breadth of Trump\\'s win left his opponents urging self-examination. \"Folks should have deep humility in this moment,\" said civil rights activist DeRay Mckesson on Twitter. \"We all have things to learn from how Trump happened.\" Karen Parnett, a 48-year-old mother of three in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said she had been heartbroken to tell her children about Trump\\'s win, and said the result illustrated the growing anger of lower-income voters who believe their concerns are being ignored by Washington. \"I have too much at stake with three kids to just throw up my hands and weep and say that all is lost,\" Parnett said. \"There are new realities and we need as a country to reckon with what in the world we are going to do about the disenfranchisement of the white working poor.\" (This story has been refiled to fix typo in ninth paragraph)',\n",
              " \"Tom, Good idea with that BAMS paper. There is also the KNMI web site, which tells that they have restricted data from Europe - on the ECA part. Both despite WMO-Res40! On IPCC, I suggested Thomas to not get too many hangers on amongst the LAs. Chs 2 and 14 are prime candidates for upping the geographic spread. We had about half of ours not doing that much last time. Isn't Tom Karl on the US nominating committee? Away all day tomorrow - CRU barbecue - so will pour down. Cheers Phil At 17:07 29/07/2009, you wrote: Hi, Phil, Yes, Friday-Saturday I noticed that ClimateFraudit had renewed their interest in you. I was thinking about sending an email of sympathy, but I was busy preparing for a quick trip to Hawaii - I left Monday morning and flew out Tuesday evening and am now in the Houston airport on my way home. Data that we can't release is a tricky thing here at NCDC. Periodically, Tom Karl will twist my arm to release data that would violate agreements and therefore hurt us in the long run, so I would prefer that you don't specifically cite me or NCDC in this. But I can give you a good alternative. You can point to the Peterson-Manton article on regional climate change workshops. All those workshops resulted in data being provided to the author of the peer-reviewed paper with a strict promise that none of the data would be released. So far as far as I know, we have all lived up to that agreement - myself with the Caribbean data (so that is one example of data I have that are not released by NCDC), Lucie and Malcolm for South America, Enric for Central America, Xuebin for Middle Eastern data, Albert for south/central Asian data, John Ceasar for SE Asia, Enric again for central Africa, etc. The point being that such agreements are common and are the only way that we have access to quantitative insights into climate change in many parts of the world. Many countries don't mind the release of derived products such as your gridded field or Xuebin's ETCCDI indices, but very much object to the release of actual data (which they might sell to potential users). Does that help? Regarding AR4, I would like to be part of it. I have no idea what role would be deemed appropriate. One thing I noticed with the CLAs in my old chapter is that if one isn't up to doing his part (too busy, or a different concept of timeliness, or ...) it can make for a difficult job. You and I have worked well together before (e.g., GSN) so I'd be delighted to work with you on it and I know you'd hold up your side of the tasks. We touched on this briefly at the AOPC meeting. If I get an opportunity, I would say yes. But I also don't know what the U.S. IPCC nominating approach would be or even who decides that. There is an upcoming IPCC report on extremes and impacts of extremes and I wasn't privy to any insights into the U.S. nominations other than when it was over it was announced in NCDC staff notes that the nominations had been made. However, Kumar had earlier asked if he could nominate me, so he did (I provided him with the details). Regards, Tom Tom, If you look on Climate Audit you will see that I'm all over it! Our ftp site is regularly trawled as I guess yours is. It seems that a Canadian along with two Americans copied some files we put there for MOHC in early 2003. So saying they have the CRU data is not quite correct. What they have is our raw data for CRUTEM2 which went into Jones and Moberg (2003) - data through end of 2002. Anyway enough of my problems - I have a question for you. I'm going to write a small document for our web site to satisfy (probably the wrong word) the 50 or so FOI/EIR requests we've had over the weekend. I will put up the various agreements we have with Met Services. The question - I think you told me one time that you had a file containing all the data you couldn't release (i.e. it's not in GHCN). Presumably this is not in your gridded datasets? Do you know off hand how much data is in this category? Would NCDC mind if I mentioned that you have such data - not the amount/locations/anything, just that there is some? On something positive - attached is the outlines for the proposed Chs in AR5/WG1. Ch1 is something Thomas thinks he can write himself - well with Qin Dahe, so only 13 chapters. There are a lot of issues with overlaps between some of the data chapters 2 with 3, 2 with 5 and 2 with 14. I'm still thinking about whether to get involved. It would be 2 if I decide. At the moment I'd say yes, but I might change my mind tomorrow! Nominations are from Nov09 thru Jan10 with the selection made in April 10. Are you considering getting involved? I have got the IPCC Secretariat and Thomas to raise the FOI issues with the full IPCC Plenary, which meets in Bali in September or October. Thomas is fully aware of all the issues we've had here wrt Ch 6 last time, and others in the US have had.

              " 'Poverty is entrenched in the Mississippi city of Durant (population less than 3, 000) but violent crime is hardly pervasive. The Police Department website lists current statistics of one report each for lost property, theft and a harassing phone call. It has been years since Durant, which is about 65 miles north of Jackson, last recorded a murder, the authorities said. But on Thursday, that sense of community and security was torn apart after two beloved nuns who worked at a medical clinic in a nearby town were found killed in their Durant home. The nuns were identified as Sister Margaret M. Held and Sister Paula J. Merrill, 68. The women were nurse practitioners who worked about 20 miles away at the Lexington Medical Clinic. Durant\\'s assistant police chief, James Lee, said an officer was sent to the sisters\\' home around 10 a. m. to conduct what he called a wellness check after they did not show up at work. The door to the home was open, he said, and the officer found the bodies inside. The Rev. Greg Plata, the priest at St. Thomas the Apostle Church in Lexington, where the nuns were active, said he had been told by the police that they were stabbed. One of their cars, a blue Toyota Corolla, was missing. Warren Strain, a spokesman for the Mississippi Department of Public Safety, said the car was found abandoned Thursday evening on a secluded street barely a mile from the home, The Associated Press reported. Father Plata said the two women were the only ones who lived in the house. It was not clear if the killings were related to their work. He said they dressed in civilian attire, or scrubs when they were at work. Chief Lee said that he could not speculate about a motive and that a cause of death had yet to be officially determined. The Police Department was being helped by the State Bureau of Investigation and the Holmes County Sheriff\\'s Department. \"An actual double homicide is an enigma,\" he said, adding that the house was in one of the quietest parts of the city and that the nuns would often jog or walk around the neighborhood. The Mississippi secretary of state, Delbert Hosemann, said in a statement that he hoped justice would be \"swiftly served. \" He said the nuns had been violently killed, adding, \"Unbridled love and care for mankind has been met with unparalleled savagery. \" Jamie Sample, 58, of Ebenezer, Miss. the music minister at St. Thomas the Apostle Church, said she had relied on the nuns for their \"gorgeous voices\" at Mass. \"I just cannot tell you what precious people they were,\" she said. \"They were just the sweetest people to ever draw a breath into their bodies. \" She described the nuns as being like family. They spent time together at the holidays, and Ms. Sample\\'s husband and son took care of their home repairs. Ms. Sample added that whoever had killed the nuns was \"the epitome of evil. \" She said Sister Margaret was an outstanding chef who regularly took delicious dishes to the church\\'s potluck events. Sister Paula\\'s nephew, David V. Merrill, 37, of Stoneham, Mass. recalled his aunt battling squirrels to grow blueberries in the backyard of their ranch house. He said she enjoyed ministering to the needy of Holmes County, where 44 percent of the residents live below the poverty level â€” the rate among the state\\'s 82 counties, according to census data. \"The work, it was her calling from God,\" Mr. Merrill said. \"She lived and loved it every day. \" Mr. Merrill said his aunt had never expressed concern about her safety. He said the biggest misgiving in the community was about the abuse of opioids. Sister Paula was a native of Massachusetts who developed a Southern drawl but retained a New Englander\\'s cynicism, he said. Maureen Smith, the communications director of the Catholic Diocese of Jackson, Miss. said Sister Paula was from the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth, based in Kentucky, and Sister Margaret was from the School Sisters of St. Francis, in Milwaukee. The United States Province Leadership team for the School Sisters said in a statement that its members were \"deeply shocked and grieved\" by the killings. It noted that Sister Margaret had been with the order for 49 years and devoted herself to \"living her ministry caring for and healing the poor. \" The two nuns had been sent by their orders to serve the poor throughout Mississippi. Sister Paula had spent 30 years in the state, the last six at the clinic, which saw 8, 000 patients last year. Four in 10 people in the county are uninsured or have only Medicaid, Ms. Smith said. The nuns were active in the church\\'s Bible study, Father Plata said, and were deeply connected to the congregation of about 30 parishioners. \"People were attracted to them because of their goodness,\" said Father Plata, who will be among the clergy members to say their funeral Mass.',\n",

The poll showed that more than 70 percent of both Senator Sanders\\' supporters and Secretary Clinton\\'s supporters would vote for the other Democratic candidate in a general election. and and roughly the same number and 72 percent of Senator Sanders\\' supporters said they would vote for Secretary Clinton, and 78 percent of Senator Sanders\\' supporters said they would vote for Secretary Clinton. In May of 2008, polling found only 60 percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for then-Senator Obama, who was eventually later elected to in a landslide victory. Furthermore, the poll shows that 80 percent of Democrats are \"mostly hopeful\" about the future of the Democratic Party, as opposed to only 55 percent of Republicans. 43 percent of Republicans are also \"mostly discouraged\" about the future of the Republican party. This echoes what we\\'ve seen in exit poll after exit poll after exit poll: Indiana : Three-quarters of Democrats in the state say they\\'ve been energized by the nomination contest between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But nearly 6 in 10 Republicans say they think their party has been divided by the battle being fought by billionaire Donald Trump, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Maryland, Pennsylvania, Connecticut : Democratic voters, unlike Republicans, said the primary season had energized their party. Two-thirds or more of Democrats who cast ballots in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Connecticut said their party was more energized, while less than one-third said it was divided, exit polls showed. New York : Almost 6 in 10 New York Republican voters say their party has been divided by the nomination process, while only 3 in 10 Democratic voters say the same about their party\\'s primaries. Less than 4 in 10 GOP voters say they\\'ve been energized, exit polls show, compared with two-thirds of Democratic voters who say that about their side. It\\'s clear that heading into the 2016 elections, Democrats are united and energized, while Republicans are disillusioned and discouraged.',\n",
              " 'Warner Bros. superhero tentpole Wonder Woman held on to the top spot at the box office while Universal\\'s Tom The Mummy reboot failed to unwrap big gains domestically as Hollywood\\'s bleak summer continued this weekend. [Wonder Woman â€” starring Gal Gadot as the Amazonian World War I peacekeeper â€” raked in $16 million Friday for an estimated $57. 2 million weekend total in its second week of release, according to Box Office Mojo. The Patty film, with a 93 percent \"fresh\" rating on reviews aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, fell just 45 percent in its second weekend for a domestic total of $205 million. The film has fared even better overseas, with its international tally standing at $435 million. Wonder Woman\\'s success â€” (the 45 percent drop is the one of the lowest ever for a superhero movie) â€” provides a shot in the arm to DC\\'s universe of superhero movies as Warners preps the launch of Justice League later this year. Meanwhile, Universal\\'s monster movie The Mummy debuted to a paltry estimated $32. 2 million frame to come in second place for the weekend. The Tom film, meant to launch Universal\\'s \"Dark Universe\" of monster movies, reportedly cost $125 million to produce before marketing, meaning the film will have to perform exceptionally well overseas to turn a profit for the studio. For comparison, each of the three Brendan Mummy films in the early 2000s opened higher than this latest iteration. Mummy did fare far better overseas, where Cruise\\'s name still carries a ton of star firepower. The film opened to an estimated $52. 2 million in China, a record for a film in the country, on its way to an international total of $141. 8 million, the best international launch for any film in the actor\\'s career. Universal undoubtedly hoped for a better opening for Mummy, as it was meant to serve as the first film in its \"Dark Universe\" series. Upcoming entries in the series are reported to include a Bill Bride of Frankenstein movie in 2019, and the Johnny The Invisible Man. Dreamworks Animation\\'s Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie came in third place with an estimated $12. 3 million haul. The animated movie featuring the voices of Kevin Hart and Ed Helms has earned $44. 5 million domestically, according to Box Office Mojo, a solid if unremarkable result for a film that reportedly cost just $30 million to produce. Disney\\'s Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales continued its underwhelming run at the box office with a estimated take of $10. 7 million and a finish, bringing its domestic total to around $135 million. Johnny Depp\\'s fifth outing as the buoyant Captain Jack Sparrow has delivered overseas, however, with an estimated global tally of close to $600 million. Disney\\'s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 rounded out this weekend\\'s top five with an estimated $6. 2 million in domestic receipts. The James superhero ensemble kicked off the summer season in early May with a $145 million debut weekend, and until Wonder Woman, was this summer\\'s only real box office hit. The film\\'s global haul stands at $828 million. Overall, the summer to date has been a disaster for studios, with only Wonder Woman and Guardians breaking out as bona fide hits. The season has suffered with a string of bombs, including Mummy, the aforementioned Pirates sequel, the Ridley sequel Alien: Covenant and Warner Bros.\\' Charlie King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. Other misfires included Paramount\\'s Baywatch reboot and the Amy Hawn kidnap caper Snatched. According to Bloomberg, theater companies AMC and IMAX have seen their stock fall precipitously this year due in part to poor box office results. Cowen Co. analyst Doug Creutz told the outlet that this summer\\'s offerings to date have collectively fallen $300 million short of expectations, and summer 2017 could beat out the summer of 2014 to become the worst summer at the box office since at least the . Industry observers will be holding out hope for other scheduled releases this summer, including next weekend\\'s Pixar animated sequel Cars 3, Michael Bay and Universal\\'s Transformers: The Last Knight, and Warner Bros\\' Christopher World War II epic Dunkirk. Other movies will include Universal\\'s Despicable Me 3, Pictures\\' : Homecoming and Fox\\'s War for the Planet of the Apes. View this weekend\\'s full box office results at Box Office Mojo.

              " 'In contrast to Obamacare, the Bush health plan envisions a much smaller role for government and a much bigger role for individual choice and competition in the marketplace. Bush health care differs from Obama health care in five significant ways: Without the employer mandate, all of the anti-job provisions in Obamacare would be gone. Right now employers have perverse incentives to keep the number of employees small, to reduce their hours of work and to use independent contractors and temp labor instead of full time employees. Under the Bush plan, no employer would be punished for creating jobs. Without the individual mandate, families would be free to buy insurance that meets individual and family needs rather than the needs of politicians. What woman would willingly choose to buy health insurance that offers free mammograms while she is healthy but makes her pay full price if there is a symptom of something wrong? That\\'s only one of the many needlessly wasteful and expensive consequences of letting health insurance benefits be determined by the political system. Also, without the individual mandate there is no reason for anybody to remain uninsured. The Bush tax credit is equal to the average tax subsidy received by employees who get their heath insurance at work. Let\\'s say a family, for whatever reason, had no additional disposable income. It would still be able to buy a health plan with its tax credit. Lower income families could qualify for additional help. I suspect they would always be able to buy Medicaid-like insurance with no additional cash outlay. But don\\'t we need mandates in order to keep people from gaming the system? We have found better ways in Medicare Part B, Medicare Part D and with Medigap insurance. In those markets, if you don\\'t buy when you are eligible, you can face penalties. In most places, if you don\\'t sign up for Medigap insurance when you are first eligible, you can be individually underwritten. The uniform tax credit is also a huge improvement. Because Obamacare conditions its subsidies on income, it raises the marginal tax rate for middle income families by six percentage points and in some cases far more. At 400 percent of poverty, a family can lose more than $10,000 in subsidies if it earns one additional dollar. At other \"cliff\" points, families can be subjected to thousands of dollars of additional exposure (higher deductibles and copayments) as a result of earning one more dollar. All these perversions vanish if everyone gets the same subsidy regardless of income. Also, if the subsidy doesn\\'t vary by income, all kinds of technical problems with healthcare.gov would vanish in a heartbeat. Virtually all the technical problems in the exchanges stem from the need to verify income. That means that the computers run by the exchanges have to interface with the computers of the IRS and other government agencies. Yet, in the main government, computer systems don\\'t know how to talk to each other and that\\'s a problem that may never be solved. If every one of the same age gets the same subsidy, the exchange doesn\\'t have to check with the IRS to verify income. Next April 15, there won\\'t be a plethora of additional taxes and refunds because almost everyone wrongly predicted his income for the previous year. According to H&R Block, as many as 3.4 million people got reduced refunds this year because they underestimated their income when they enrolled in ObamaCare insurance plans. The portability provision is another huge improvement over the current system. Right now if employers give employees pre-tax dollars to buy their own insurance in the individual market, the Obama administration is threatening to fine them $100 per employee per day. If you think that\\'s overkill, it tells you just how much the current administration dislikes employees buying and owning their own insurance. With the Bush plan, all the anti-portability provisions in current law will be gone.',\n",

              " 'I almost gave this a 5 star review, but as much as I WANTED to, I just couldn\\'t quite for one reason - the buttons. To give a bit of background, I have a great room that has only four recessed cans in the ceiling to light the whole room. To along the peak of the ceiling, and two down one slope over the fireplace. The controls for the two main ones are in a bank with the switches for the hallway and the kitchen, right in my traffic pattern. The controls for the two on the other edge of the room are next to the fireplace, the exact opposite side of the room. So those don\\'t get used too often, despite how useful they can be sometimes. So lighting has been a real pain in here, especially as I bounced from one type of light to another trying to find something that worked well. The main ones that are always on after sundown are LED\\'s now, nice 6k units that brighten up the area I\\'m in just fine. But often when my son and I are building Lego or Megablok sets, we need the other lights after sunset since the two main just don\\'t provide enough light. That\\'s about the only time I usually turn on the others. I thought if I had a remote for them, I\\'d be more likely to use them when needed for other things. This is my third or fourth try to get some kind of wireless control for this location. The others were just too bulky to fit within the \"standard\" box the builders used here for the wall switch. This is the first that fit, and it didn\\'t even have to be crammed in there. It came with the three wire connectors to hook it up to the wires from the walls, and they were large enough to cover the stripped part of the copper on the existing wires, but not so large as to be too bulky to shove behind the box of the dimmer. The wall plate is two pices, the one piece with screws that screws to the actual switch hardware, then a plate that snaps into place over that, so this plate DOES stick out from the wall more than a standard wall plate does, noticeably more. Installation took me all of 6 minutes from start to finish, including two trips to the basement to turn the circuit off and back on. The remote comes unsynchronized, so you have to sync it with the switch. Easy enough, hold OFF on the wall switch for 10 seconds or so, then do the same on the OFF switch on the remote. It works well. I like the dimming up it does for the bulbs when turned on, and that it dims off as well, rather than just instant brightness or darkness. The \"favorite\" raised button on the remote is handy if you have a preferred setting you want to use most of the time, The remote is responsive and accurate - I\\'ve not had any misfires. Now the reason I took a star off - the buttons. I really hate the feel of them. There\\'s a button centered in the undersized buttons, and they roll all around it, in all directions. So it always feels like it\\'s about to come loose or something. They tilt all around that center pivot point if you hit one of the edges. The other downside is that there is no \"favorite\" or \"last\" setting for the wall switch itself. I had installed the MACL-153M-WH switch for my mom at her condo, and that\\'s just the single button, feels better, and remembers a favorite setting from just the wall switch. This one doesn\\'t have the same functionality unfortunately. My other wishlist item would\\'ve been that it have an LED somewhere for easy finding in the dark. But the LED\\'s are only on if the light is on. The whole \"raised icon\" to \"easily find in the dark\" really seems pretty useless to me - if you\\'ve already got your hands on the switch and can feel the raised icon, clearly you\\'ve ALREADY found the switch... Apparently the CFL\\'s I had in the cans were not dimmable, since as soon as I turned this on, they just started blinking on and off. This wouldn\\'t even work with them as a simple on/off switch. But that was good, it gave me the excuse to buy some better LED\\'s, as these were the only cans left that I hadn\\'t swapped to LED yet. But as I said, this is the first switch I\\'ve tried at home that fit my switch box in the wall. It works very well, despite my lack of enthusiasm for the buttons.',\n",

              " 'The U.S. power sector\\'s shift toward burning less coal and using more natural gas and renewable energy will not be derailed by the Supreme Court ruling against the Obama administration\\'s limits on carbon emissions, state regulators and utilities said on Wednesday. The U.S. Supreme Court decided 5-4 on Tuesday to block the Environmental Protection Agency\\'s carbon emissions crackdown on coal plants until a legal challenge is resolved. Some states may now slow work on compliance with the EPA\\'s Clean Power Plan. But some experts said they were confident the rule will survive the legal challenge when the D.C. circuit court makes a decision this summer. \"In a way we are really just postponing the inevitable,\" said Vicki Arroyo, executive director of the Georgetown Climate Center. Even in some of the 27 states that sued to block the rule, officials had been working on compliance plans. Most states said they will continue to decarbonize their energy supply. Utilities across the country have already begun a major shift away from coal-fired electricity toward cleaner burning and cheaper natural gas and renewables like wind and solar. \"We fully expect that many of these states will continue their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under their own legal authorities,\" said Bill Becker, director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies. States like California, Colorado and New York criticized the high court\\'s decision and vowed to pursue their plans to shift to cleaner energy regardless of the delay in the EPA rule. Meanwhile, states like Montana and North Dakota that joined in the lawsuit against the EPA welcomed the \"breathing room\" the stay provides. But even these opponents of the rule said they will keep diversifying their power supply. Colorado\\'s Democratic Governor John Hickenlooper said the state will keep working on compliance so it \"is not left at a disadvantage if the courts uphold all or part of the Clean Power Plan.\" Colorado challenged the EPA plan even though the governor supports it. The state\\'s Republican attorney general disagrees about the legality of the rule and its economic impact. Montana Governor Steve Bullock, a Democrat, opposed the EPA rule. He said the state would put on hold the work of a group to devise compliance options, but added that it still needs \"to address climate change and embrace Montana\\'s energy future.\" He said: \"I am committed to ensuring we do so on our own terms.\" For coal-producing North Dakota, which had one of the highest emission reduction targets to meet under the rule, regulators and utilities will keep working on ways to lower power plant emissions, said state health department chief Dave Glatt. He said the EPA plan did not give the state \"a sufficient amount of time to have reasonable solutions.\" He pledged to \"look at reasonable steps forward.\" For most states, coal-fired electricity has been in decline. In 2015, generators shut over 15,000 megawatts of coal-fired power plants, the most in any year, as low gas prices drove down power costs. It became uneconomical to overhaul older coal plants even to meet existing federal clean air rules. Ohio regulators said Wednesday they were not sure how the state will respond to the court decision, but the state\\'s major utilities are already shifting away from coal. American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP.N) will continue generating more power with natural gas and renewable energy since prices for those have dropped significantly, said spokeswoman Melissa McHenry. She added that the five-year extension of federal renewable energy tax credits has given AEP an incentive to bring more renewable energy into the mix. \"It makes sense that we are sticking to our current plans, and will be positioned to respond to the courts\\' ultimate decision on the future of the Clean Power Plan,\" she said. Another Ohio utility, FirstEnergy Corp (FE.N), said it already retired a number of older coal plants in 2012. The court decision will have little impact. \"The Supreme Court decision does not change the path we are on,\" said spokeswoman Jennifer Young. \"We think it is the right thing to do â€“ this is a complicated issue and this decision will give the states the appropriate amount of time to develop their compliance plans.\"',\n",

              " 'Comrades, A young lady from the West Coast sent me this article tonight that she wrote for her College paper on a known Political figure (yours truely). She said it was not published in the school paper because it was too controversial for them, but here it is for our readers... *Commander Jeff Schoep* Think of an American champion. Someone who fights for the greater good, a noble cause, and selflessly dedicates their life to better yours. You might think of John Adams, Ronald Reagan, Martin Luther King Jr., or even a military hero such as George Patton. All of these men were not afraid to challenge controversial ideas and would never admit defeat. They were rightly put into history books, and became legends. What we admire about them is their will to fight, and its what makes them heroes. I found a living champion in the city of Detroit, Michigan. His name is Commander Jeff Schoep, an extremely controversial political figure in charge of the largest neo-Nazi group in the United States. The National Socialist Movement is an organization dedicated to the preservation of their \"proud European heritage\" and the creation of a National Socialist Society in America and around the world. As Commander, Schoep over sees the NSM organization, NSM88 Record Label and Radio, New Saxon website, and most recently SS Enterprise. By now, its obvious why Commander Jeff Schoep holds a position which many would find contentious. NSM has grown considerably since the Schoep took office in 1994, an vital action for the organization whose numbers were dwindling. Since Schoep stepped into the shoes of former Commander Cliff Herrington, he has taken a staggering amount of poor publicity. The endless supposed \"inside\" editorials \"exposing\" NSM, and with it their Commander seem to be constantly bombarding mainstream America. But numbers don\\'t lie! Under Commander Jeff Schoep NSM has gained in strength, numbers, and their business prospects continue to grow and flourish. It seems NSM is not only resilient but the negative publicity has encouraged people to join their cause, and convince current members to steadily hold fast to their beliefs. This is a direct reflection of the action, leadership and dedication of the Commander. As a leader he not only makes it his career, but his life\\'s purpose to spread his message of unity through a \"greater America\". He religiously signs off as, \"If you\\'re not part of the Solution, you\\'re part of the Problem.\" While he is advocating for his cause, gaining membership and bringing groups of people together under one ideal, obscure \"journalists\" looking for something or someone to slur, attempt to further tear a fragile America apart. Now you tell me who the bad guy is. Maybe you don\\'t agree with his principles, but you have to admit the Commander is persistent in the face of a hostile contradiction. Why hasn\\'t the Commander gotten any positive, or even neutral credit for the work he has done? Do we, as a society only give recognition to those people whose causes we deem \"appropriate\" or \"popular\"? Its more than obvious what the answer is. And its unfortunate because I believe that Commander Jeff Schoep has surely pushed NSM forward against almost impossible odds.

              " 'President Trump lashed out at the nation\\'s intelligence agencies again on Wednesday, saying that his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, was brought down by illegal leaks to the news media, on a day of new disclosures about the Trump camp\\'s dealings with Russia during and after the presidential campaign. \"From intelligence, papers are being leaked, things are being leaked,\" Mr. Trump said at a White House news conference with Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel. \"It\\'s a criminal action, criminal act, and it\\'s been going on for a long time before me, but now it\\'s really going on. And people are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton. \" With his statement and a burst of posts he made on Twitter, Mr. Trump tried to shift attention from damaging questions about contacts with Russia by Mr. Flynn and others close to the president, arguing that the outrage is not those contacts, but the leaks about them. He revived his charge that the allegations of a \"Russian connection\" were nothing more than a Democratic conspiracy, fed to a receptive news media to distract from the mistakes made by Mrs. Clinton during the campaign. The White House has said that Mr. Trump demanded Mr. Flynn\\'s resignation on Monday night, after it was revealed that Mr. Flynn, a retired Army general, had misled Vice President Mike Pence and other officials about his conversations with a Russian diplomat. But on Wednesday, the president said that Mr. Flynn had \"been treated very, very unfairly by the media,\" undercut by \"documents and papers that were illegally â€” I\\'d stress that, illegally â€” leaked. \" Earlier, he had posted on Twitter, \"Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI? ). Just like Russia\" The New York Times and The Washington Post had reported on the contacts Mr. Flynn had with Russia\\'s ambassador to Washington, Sergey I. Kislyak. Mr. Flynn initially told Mr. Pence and others that he and Mr. Kislyak did not discuss matters of substance, like United States sanctions against Russia, but in the days after Mr. Trump\\'s inauguration, the Justice Department notified the White House that he had not been forthright about the conversations. The Times also disclosed broader contacts between Russian intelligence officials and people with ties to the Trump campaign and Mr. Trump\\'s business empire during and after the campaign, and other news organizations followed with similar reports. The president declined to address that revelation and, as he has at other times in recent days, took questions at his news conference only from conservative news organizations and ignored more challenging questions shouted to him as he left the podium. So far, the White House has had little success in trying to shift the narrative from the Russian contacts to accusations about the leaking of sensitive information by the intelligence agencies, as well as by the F. B. I. Mr. Trump used a similar strategy during the transition, after disclosures that the intelligence agencies presented him with a dossier containing potentially compromising â€” but unsubstantiated â€” information that Russian officials had collected on him during his travels to Russia. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said on Twitter, \"The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!\" The president also praised a column by Eli Lake of Bloomberg View, which criticized the selective leaking of intercepted communications between Mr. Flynn and Mr. Kislyak. Mr. Lake went on to suggest, however, that Mr. Flynn had been sacrificed to protect other officials, potentially including the president himself. Mr. Trump, as he has before, rejected allegations that his policy toward Russia was being compromised. \"Crimea was TAKEN by Russia during the Obama Administration. Was Obama too soft on Russia?\" he posted on Twitter.',\n",
              " 'U.S. Senate Republicans have reached a tentative budget deal that could allow tax reform legislation to eliminate as much as $1.5 trillion in revenues over 10 years through tax cuts, raising the odds that their planned tax overhaul would expand the federal deficit. Two members of the Senate Budget Committee, Republicans Pat Toomey and Bob Corker, announced the formal agreement late on Tuesday, but their joint news release did not provide dollar figures for revenue reduction or tax cuts. The prospective tax cuts are part of closed-door talks among 12 Senate Budget Committee Republicans who are drafting a fiscal 2018 budget measure needed to help the 100-member Senate pass a tax overhaul with as few as 51 Republicans votes and prevent Democrats from blocking the legislation. The U.S. economy is in a steady expansion and stock markets are rising. But the tax cuts being weighed by congressional Republicans, with encouragement from President Donald Trump, are on a scale normally reserved for times of economic hardship and intended to drive annual economic growth above 3 percent. Trump campaigned last year on a promise of comprehensive tax reform. But Republicans have made little tangible progress toward that ambitious goal so far. Toomey told reporters he is confident that Republicans will agree to a budget resolution that foresees a deficit in the first decade. He said, however, that talks have not settled definitively on $1.5 trillion. \"I\\'d like to see a bigger number,\" said Toomey, who argues that tax cuts would increase economic growth. In their joint news release, Toomey and Corker said they agreed on a budget resolution that would use a standard analysis of the impact of the tax cuts on the deficit. Some Republicans like Toomey have pushed for a \"dynamic\" model, which tends to assume an increased economic stimulus effect from tax cuts, resulting in smaller projected increases to the deficit. Senator John Thune, a member of the Senate Republican leadership team, said he expected the agreement to provide maximum flexibility to craft a tax overhaul capable of driving economic growth and ultimately raising worker wages. But looming in the background is Washington\\'s steady flow of red ink that adds every year to the $20 trillion national debt, a target of outrage not long ago for Republican \"fiscal hawks.\" In recent weeks, some fiscal hawks have expressed a willingness to consider deficit financing for tax reform but many at levels well below $500 billion. Toomey\\'s comments suggest Senate Republicans may be looking to deficit spending as a way to cut taxes on businesses and individuals while avoiding hard decisions that would be needed to raise taxes elsewhere or eliminate popular tax breaks. If adopted by Congress in a budget resolution, the $1.5 trillion figure would set a ceiling on how much revenue tax reform could eliminate over 10 years. Analysts and Democrats have warned that higher deficits resulting from tax cuts would eventually overwhelm economic growth at a time when U.S. interest rates are set to rise. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, whose panel would use the budget figure in crafting a tax reform bill, told reporters he was not sure that revenue losses of $1.5 trillion were needed for tax reform. Senator Ron Wyden, the Senate Finance Committee\\'s top Democrat, dismissed the development as a distraction from the more important question of how Republican tax reform would ultimately benefit the wealthy. \"It looks to me like yet another trial balloon,\" Wyden said. Republicans have been unable to agree on how to pay for tax cuts and other proposed tax changes, aside from arguing that some lost revenue would be clawed back from the buoyant economic growth they believe tax reform will deliver. \"There\\'s no way you\\'re going to be able to do tax cuts that pay for themselves,\" said Louisiana Senator John Kennedy, another budget committee Republican. \"But I think most people would concede that cutting taxes does stimulate the economy.\"',\n",
              " 'Venezuela\\'s socialist dictator NicolÃ¡s Maduro claimed on national television Saturday that the nation\\'s opposition was \"murdering its own protesters,\" listing individuals killed by Venezuelan soldiers and Chavista gangs and blaming the leadership of the opposition for staging the deaths to garner support for their cause. [Maduro did not present any evidence to justify his claim. \"These protests today are only in one percent of the nation,\" Maduro claimed on state television. \"They are more violent than ever, you have all seen cases where they have murdered their own protesters. \" He listed three cases of alleged staged murders, two shot to death and a third allegedly electrocuted. \"If it weren\\'t for Julio Borges and the MUD none of these tragedies would have happened,\" he alleged. Borges is the president of the National Assembly, the federal legislative body, and a party leader in the coalition known as the Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD). He has personally been the victim of state violence, beaten by a Chavista gang (colectivo) near the entrance of the National Assembly building in 2016. The gang succeeded in breaking his nose. Maduro also blamed Borges personally in a separate video segment for allegedly sending a gang to kidnap a bus driver. Maduro did not explain who kidnapped the driver or why, but by Monday, Venezuelan state television was showcasing a photo opportunity with Maduro and the driver, identified as Leonardo Leconte, on its online front page. At least 39 people have been killed in this most recent wave of protests, which began in March following an attempt by the Supreme Court to nullify the National Assembly and establish itself as the chief lawmaking body. The Venezuelan newspaper El Universal lists among them two of the most recent cases that align with the descriptions Maduro used in his remarks: Miguel Fernando Castillo Bracho, 27, and Anderson Dugarte, 38, who were both shot to death. The odds of opposition members being responsible for these shootings are barely existent, however, because of Venezuela\\'s strict laws. The opposition is almost completely unarmed, as the private ownership of firearms is banned. Only criminal gangs and colectivos, some of whom operate as official paramilitaries, have the firearms used in these circumstances. In 2014, Maduro opened \"disarmament centers\" to pressure the few remaining civilians possessing weapons to return them. Three years later, Maduro promised a firearm to every Chavista who swore to use them against the opposition, setting a goal of distributing one million firearms to \"militiamen\" working for the government. Many other protester deaths cannot be explained as deeds of the opposition. Among the most notable are the protesters the military has killed on Maduro\\'s orders. In one particularly gruesome incident caught on video, soldiers ran unarmed protesters over using large armored vehicles, killing at least three. Others among the 39 died without even meaning to protest, among them Ricarda GonzÃ¡lez, who died asphyxiated by tear gas in her home. Only the military has access to tear gas and has used it liberally against protesters. Maduro\\'s claim that the opposition is killing their own people recalls propaganda tactics used by its allies in the Middle East. The government of Iran, a longtime Chavista ally, has been particularly bold in denying violence that investigators have traced back to them. In 2015, when Uruguayan officials accused the Iranian government of using employees at its embassy to plant explosives near the Israeli embassy in Montevideo, Iranian officials accused Israel of bombing its own embassy to \"create Iranophobia and tarnish the Islamic Republic\\'s international image. \" \"Tehran has said in the past that Tel Aviv has ordered attacks against its own embassies in India and Georgia in order to damage Iran\\'s image in the host countries,\" the Iranian government said at the time. Similarly, another ally of Tehran\\'s, Syria\\'s Bashar has accused Syrian rebels of attacking its own to frame his government for assorted human rights abuses. Following a Syrian government chemical weapons attack on civilians in April, Assad said the United States and Syrian rebels \"fabricated the whole story in order to have a pretext for the attack [a U. S. airstrike against the Syrian air force]. \" Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.',\n",

Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) March 21, 2016The way I see it, it s our job to make sure @realDonaldTrump ends this campaign every bit the loser that he started it. Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) March 21, 2016Warren s tweets all hit at what are considered soft spots for Trump. He has boasted about his huge wealth, but numerous reports indicate that his net worth is considerably exaggerated. From Trump biographer Timothy O Brien:On a single day in August 2004, he told me his net worth was $4 billion to $5 billion, then revised that later the same day to $1.7 billion. Forbes said at the time he was worth $2.6 billion. A year later Donald told me he was worth $5 billion to $6 billion, but a brochure left on my nightstand at his Palm Beach resort said he was worth $9.5 billion.The tweets also discuss Trump s sexism, which appears to be one of his major Achilles heels. When Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly pointed out his history of demeaning women, he complained she was bleeding out of her whatever, and still months later has referred to her as crazy, which drew an uncharacteristic rebuke of a Republican from the right-wing propaganda network.Perhaps most importantly, Warren is indicating to the mainstream media and other Democrats that Trump s racially motivated campaign won t be off limits to criticism. So far, Republicans have largely avoided hitting Trump on his offensive language towards latinos and Muslims, as well as towards black activists (he called for protesters to be punched). The Democrats largely have no interest in courting the racists that dwell in the base of the GOP, and have no such restrictions on what they can say in the general election.It looks like the fight is truly on.',\n",

Date: Tue, 3 Sep 2002 22:49:20 -0600 Bob, This capacitor drive idea isn\\'t completely stupid, but neither is it well thought out. Maxwell (www.maxwell.com) makes and sells high energy density capacitors, called ultracapacitors. They deliver them in an air-cooled, voltage regulated module that will charge to 42 V and hold 128 kilojoules -- roughly the energy in 2 teaspoons of sugar or a bite of a donut -- and weighs 16 kilograms. If that electrical energy could all be converted to kinetic energy, there\\'s enough to get the capacitor module up to about 200 mph -- in a vacuum. Suppose you take the entire power density of the capacitor module -- 2.8 kw/kg (~4 hp/kg!) -- and punch it through an electric motor. How much does the 64 hp electric motor weigh? If it were as little as 50 kg -- and I bet it isn\\'t -- that capacitor and motor would have a top speed of 100 mph -- the speed at which their energy is the 128 kJ that was initially stored electrically in the capacitor. And it\\'s not at all obvious that the torque vs. speed characteristic of 42 V DC motors will support this, or how they do it without wheels, drive train, etc. But if they can, they can only do it in a vacuum where there is no drag!

              " 'After Taiwan s state-run Mega Financial Holding Co was fined $180 million by U.S. authorities for lax enforcement of anti-money-laundering rules at its New York branch, the bank started a rigorous training program for its staff. Now, like Mega Financial, companies across Taiwan are working to get staff and systems up to speed after the island passed laws to meet international standards on combating money laundering and was taken off a watchlist by the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG). Unfortunately, Taiwan has earned a name for itself as a paradise for money laundering, Deputy Justice Minister Tsai Pi-chung told Reuters. Money laundering and cybercrime connections to Taiwan, which is also in the process of pushing through a cyber security bill, have grabbed global headlines. U.S. authorities fined Mega Financial $180 million last year for lax enforcement of anti-money-laundering rules at its New York branch. Some money from the $170 million cyber heist of India s Union Bank of India was transferred through Taiwan s Bank SinoPac. An international crime ring used malware to steal $2.6 million from the ATMs of Taiwan s First Bank. Taiwan was one of the six most targeted countries of the Wannacry ransomware attack earlier this year, according to security company Avast. Since 2011, 800 people from China and Taiwan have been deported from Cambodia on suspicion of telecoms fraud. Following its U.S. fine, Mega Financial said cleaning up its act is a top priority. U.S. authorities had said the Mega branch had been indifferent to the risks associated with transactions involving Panama, a high-risk area for money laundering. What happened at our New York branch was just terrible, said Robert Tsai, a senior executive vice president, referring to the fine and ensuing scandal. Half of our 6,000 clerks have been certified with anti-money laundering training. How each of our branches implements the rules and ensures proper training is the top priority for our business. To gain international confidence in its anti-money laundering measures, Taiwan will have to demonstrate it is putting the laws into practice. The APG will review Taiwan in 2018. The visit will focus on how effectively Taiwan will have actually implemented the anti-money laundering rules, said Liang Hung-lieh, partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers Taiwan. The APG s on-site review will be new to most of the assessed, including banks, non-bank financial institutions and in particular non-financial institutions such as lawyers, public certified accountants and other professional service providers. Under the anti-money laundering laws, these financial professionals will be required to report suspicious transactions, including bank transfers exceeding T$500,000 (US$16,500). They will have to determine where the money came from, provide details about the client and report that to Taiwan s newly established Anti-Money Laundering Office. These are similar to regulations that countries that have signed up to global anti-money laundering rules overseen by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) have adopted. The cost to companies of implementing the new rules may be significant as they put processes, workers and data systems in place. There s a lot of extra work for them to do now, such as determining the identities of their clients beneficiaries, said an official with the Financial Supervisory Commission, the island s financial regulator. He declined to be identified in the absence of permission to speak to the media. They don t yet know exactly what they have to do, and to what extent, to be considered compliant with the new regulations. They re going to need some time to digest all of these new rules, he said. The potential costs and increased difficulty of getting transactions done under the new rules worry those in the property market, said Wong Jui-chi, the spokesman for Taiwan s Chinese Association of Real Estate brokers, while emphasizing that his industry intends to fully comply with the regulations. The property market is already in a bad shape and these new rules will make things worse by making the process of real estate transactions more complicated. More or less everyone in our industry is complaining about it, he said.',\n",
              " \"Wednesday morning, Donald Trump started his day off just like any normal bizarre despot, with tweets celebrating the world s fear and outrage at his nuclear threats toward North Korea. He retweeted Fox & Friends on Twitter no less than three times for their breathless coverage of his manly escapades. But in the middle of his bluster, Trump forgot once again that the internet is a forever place, where no facts are ever lost, except to the swirling vortex of a Trump supporter s mind.Perhaps he was relying on that very fact that his supporters will believe anything he says when he made a claim about his first order as president. In a pair of tweets continuing the theme of the day, Trump asserted that he was responsible for the modernization of our nuclear program:My first order as President was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal. It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before . Donald J.

Not only was that not his first order that was on Obamacare but it wasn t even him that began the renovation and modernization process. That would be the guy before him.

Alarming thing to lie about. https://t.co/9cizhVLJAU Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) August 9, 2017So we all have to rally around the leader because he decided to threaten North Korea with nuclear destruction. Get ready for more of this. https://t.co/P5STDMVWMy Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) August 9, 2017Boasting about the size of our nuclear arsenal and sending aides out to demand we rally around the leader is chilling. And it's only month 7 Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) August 9, 2017It s not the first time Trump has lied about things he s done, and it certainly won t be the last. But the fact that this is a lie about nukes makes it a little more alarming and indicates that Trump truly doesn t understand the gravity of the situation. Already, we re seeing reports from aides saying that Trump wasn t actually serious in making his nuclear threats. But this isn t something to be taken lightly.What s more, there s plenty of reason to be concerned about the very first thing Trump did do regarding our nuclear arsenal, in case anyone s forgotten. He put a guy he beat in the primary by calling him a dumbass in charge of it.\",\n",
              " 'The centerpiece of President Barack Obama\\'s climate change strategy faced a key test on Tuesday as conservative appeals court judges questioned whether his administration overstepped its legal authority under an air pollution law to make sweeping changes to the U.S. electric sector. Twenty-seven states led by coal-producer West Virginia and industry groups are challenging the Environmental Protection Agency\\'s Clean Power Plan rules before 10 judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. They argue that the EPA overstepped its regulatory authority under the federal Clean Air Act when the agency issued rules to curb greenhouse emissions mainly from coal-fired power plants. The U.S. Supreme Court has put the regulations on hold while the case is litigated. Tuesday\\'s highly anticipated arguments drew a crowd of hundreds at sunrise to watch the opponents face off against the EPA, 18 states and some supportive power companies. The EPA told the judges that the agency had the power under the Clean Air Act to craft the rule, and that it was cost-effective and achievable. The challengers could face an uphill battle to win over a majority of the 10 judges, six of whom are Democratic appointees. Judge Brett Kavanaugh, appointed by former President George W. Bush, said while he understands the political and moral obligation to address global warming and the importance of the United States to international climate action, the Clean Power Plan\\'s impact on the U.S. economy and on certain coal-reliant communities should require Congress to have a say. \"This is a huge case. It has huge economic consequences,\" said Kavanaugh. He added that climate change does not give the EPA a \"blank check\" to use the Clean Air Act flexibly. Judge Thomas Griffith, another Bush appointee, questioned: \"Why is this (debate) not going-on on the Congress floor but in front of a room full of unelected judges?\" The EPA argued before that the Supreme Court has already given the EPA authority in previous cases to use the section of the Clean Air Act at issue to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Justice Department lawyer Eric Hostetler, representing the EPA, said the agency designed the rule to be cost effective and \"deepen\" the shift already taking place toward cleaner energy. \"The EPA looked at what was going on in the real world,\" he said, noting that most states are already shifting the make-up of their electric generation. In comments indicating support for the government\\'s position, Judge Judith Rogers, appointed to the court by former President Bill Clinton, said the EPA should not close its eyes to trends in the electric sector which have seen utilities diversify their energy mix. \"You can\\'t survive in this market unless you do that,\" she said. Some of the other Democratic appointees voiced similar sentiments indicating they did not think the regulations constituted a major shift as the challengers argue. The Clean Power Plan was designed to lower carbon emissions from U.S. power plants by 2030 to 32 percent below 2005 levels. Power plants are the largest source of U.S. carbon emissions. The Clean Power Plan is the main tool for the United States to meet the emissions reduction target it pledged to reach at U.N. climate talks in Paris last December. The fate of the Clean Power Plan was thrown into question on Feb. 9 when the Supreme Court made a surprise 5-4 decision to grant a request by the challengers to put the rule on hold while the appeals court considered the matter. The eventual appeals court ruling could decide the case, even if it goes to the Supreme Court. The Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia left the court ideologically split with four conservatives and four liberals. A 4-4 ruling by the high court would leave in place the appeals court ruling. The case is being heard by 10 judges rather than 11 because the court\\'s chief judge, Merrick Garland, has recused himself from the case. Garland is Obama\\'s nominee to replace Scalia. A 5-5 ruling would leave the regulations in place. A ruling is unlikely before the end of the year and possibly not until after Obama leaves office on Jan. 20. The outcome of the Nov. 8 presidential election could be pivotal for the regulations. If Republican Donald Trump wins, the government could reverse the rules or decline to appeal to the Supreme Court should the appeals court strike them down. If Democrat Hillary Clinton is elected, the losing side in the appeals court ruling could be expected to take the case to the Supreme Court. If the case does reach the high court, it may not make it in time for the justices to hear it during the court term that begins next Monday and ends in June.',\n",
              " \"An atheist group has found a truly genius way to troll christian conservatives over their $101m Noah s Ark being built in Kentucky by crowdfunding mock billboards for the christian theme park. Author and columnist Dan Arel writes in Pathos that a group called the Tri-State Freethinkers are raising $2,000 to place billboards which name the Ark Adventure Genocide and Incest Park. Image via IndiegogoThe Indiegogo page for the project states:The billboards are likely to serious annoy the Ark Adventure team, who have lurched from one crisis to another in their attempts to set up the site.Australian-born Creationist Ken Ham and his fundamentalist Christian organization Answers in Genesis (AiG) are looking to build a $101m Ark Adventure in Kentucky, with the centerpiece of a reconstructed Ark. The problem is, they want you the taxpayer to pay for it.According to Newsweek, AiG purchased a 99-acre plot of land just outside Williamstown, Kentucky got the city for just a dollar five years ago. But since then, the project has hit one hurdle after another. Many, of Ham s own making.The principal issue at stake now, is that Ham and AiG want the taxpayer to pick up the bill for around a quarter of the construction costs of the project in the form of tax rebates. The group sought to exploit subsidies provided by the state to boost tourism through the Tourism Development Incentive program. Projects of $1 million and upwards can recover 25% of project development costs by recouping their sales taxes.After much debate on their initial application, Kentucky approved the site for the scheme so long as AiG agreed to non-discriminatory hiring practices. This means, they could only recover the cash if they recruited people of all faiths and none. They could not specifically hire Creationists.A few bumps down the road later, and Ham and AiG had to significantly strip back their pans for the park. They were unable to gather together the funds and investment to create the full theme park. Due to the substantial changes to the plans, they had to resubmit their application to Kentucky for the tax rebate. This time is was denied. Why? Because apparently, honesty and integrity mean nothing to this group of creationists.Despite their reluctant agreements to get their hands on state cash, AiG had released a decidedly discriminatory recruitment policy for the Ark Adventure. The website demanded a salvation testimony and a creationist statement of faith from all prospective job applicants clearly ruling out non-believers.So now, Ken Ham and AiG are suing Kentucky for the money claiming religious discrimination. Greg Lipper, senior litigation counsel for Americans United for Separation of Church and State points out the muddled-thinking that AiG is applying in this case. AiG is confusing what they have the right to do as a private organization with what taxpayers are required to fund, They re saying Kentucky taxpayers should pay for them to expand a religious ministry. That kind of argument would make Thomas Jefferson turn in his grave. No one is telling Ham as a private citizen, who or how he can hire. It is only as a recipient of state funds, an agreement which he is free to enter or not, that he is required to follow the stipulations that would be applied to any organization or individual doing the same. Just like chances of his theory of genesis being true, Ham s chances of getting his lawsuit through are slim to none.And his Ark hasn t escaped the attention of social media users either I just realised that America's immigration policy doesn't weed out Australian Ark Building Lunatics. #kenham Michael (@gotapulse) January 3, 2016If #KenHam could get a 500 yr old dude & his kids to build the Ark themselves w/o modern technology I would give the park more credit. Uncle John (@azmoderate) January 18, 2016If the universe was capable of giving Ken Ham and his cohorts a sign that their project was doomed to failure, this comedy of errors and public embarrassments would be it.\",\n",
              " 'The presidential campaigns of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich announced late Sunday that they were coordinating their efforts in three upcoming primary states in an extraordinary attempt to prevent Republican front-runner Donald Trump from clinching the GOP nomination before this summer\\'s convention. In a pair of simultaneously released statements, the campaigns announced that Kasich would pull out of Indiana to give Cruz \"a clear path\" ahead of that state\\'s winner-take-all primary May 3, while the Cruz campaign will \"clear the path\" for Kasich in Oregon, which votes May 17, and New Mexico, which votes June 7. \"Having Donald Trump at the top of the ticket in November would be a sure disaster for Republicans,\" Cruz\\'s campaign manager, Jeff Roe, said. \"To ensure that we nominate a Republican who can unify the Republican Party and win in November, our campaign will focus its time and resources in Indiana and in turn clear the path for Gov. Kasich to compete in Oregon and New Mexico, and we would hope that allies of both campaigns would follow our lead.\" The arrangement marks a sharp reversal for Cruz\\'s team, which aggressively opposed the idea of a coordinated anti-Trump effort as recently as late last week. Yet it underscores a bleak reality for the billionaire businessman\\'s Republican foes: Time is running out to stop him. A statement from the Trump campaign called the move \"a horrible act of desperation from two campaigns who have horribly failed.\" The Kasich campaign confirmed to Fox News that it had canceled two Indiana campaign events scheduled for Tuesday. As recently as three days ago Kasich\\'s campaign announced investments in Indiana, including the opening of two offices and the creation of a campaign leadership team. Campaign manager John Weaver said in his statement that the Kasich team hoped to perform well in Oregon and New Mexico, which Weaver said were \"structurally similar\" to northeastern states where Kasich performed well earlier in the cycle. \"Our goal is to have an open convention in Cleveland,\" Weaver added, \"where we are confident a candidate capable of uniting the party and winning in November will emerge as the nominee.\" The announcement came less than 48 hours before voting begins across five Northeastern states where the New York billionaire is poised to add to his already overwhelming delegate lead. Trump campaigned Sunday in Maryland, which will vote on Tuesday along with Rhode Island, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Delaware. Trump needs 1,237 delegates to win the Republican nomination. If he falls short, the national Republican gathering in July will evolve into a rare contested convention. At a rally in Hagerstown, Md., Trump stressed repeatedly that he expects to win the 1,237 delegates needed in the first round of voting to stave off a contested convention. \"I only care about the first. We\\'re not going for the second and third and fourth and fifth,\" said Trump. Even before the plan was announced, Cruz had all but abandoned the Northeastern states in favor of Indiana, which holds its primary on May 3. Both Cruz and Kasich had cast the state as a critical turning point. \"Keeping Trump from winning a plurality in Indiana is critical to keeping him under 1,237 bound delegates before Cleveland,\" Kasich\\'s campaign said Sunday. \"We are very comfortable with our delegate position in Indiana already, and given the current dynamics of the primary there, we will shift our campaign\\'s resources west and give the Cruz campaign a clear path in Indiana.\" Indiana will award 57 delegates to the winner of its primary. Oregon and New Mexico have 28 and 24 proportionately awarded delegates at stake, respectively. Fox News\\' Dan Gallo and the Associated Press contributed to this report.',\n",
              " 'The political left and the mainstream media (but I repeat myself) still reeling from the results of the November election, found traction this weekend in the debate over crowd sizes with the new Trump administration. [For their purposes, it matters less what the Trump said, and even less what the crowd sizes were (or why) and more that they were able to create a common filter through which they will interpret subsequent events as they muster an opposition (pretentiously called \"resistance\"). First, the facts. The crowd on Inauguration Day was massive, and from the front sections â€” where this reporter was lucky enough to have seats â€” it looked like the entire mall was full. Trump â€” and anyone else seeing the event from that vantage point â€” could be forgiven for thinking the crowd was at least a million strong, or more. Taking him to task for speculating about that was simply petty. Press Secretary Sean Spicer was correct: the media were trying to undermine the new president. At the same time, the crowd did not feel overwhelming. And that was partly by design. The left did its best to scare Trump supporters away by threatening violence. Furthermore, the timing (on a Friday) and the high price of traveling to, and staying in, Washington over a weekend kept many Trump fans at home. A good portion of the protesters who came in from out of town had probably already booked their travel plans in anticipation of a Hillary Clinton win, driving prices up. The size of the crowds at the respective events was not an issue until the media made it one. In his combative statement to the press on Saturday, Spicer correctly noted that there were some media reports of crowd size that were clearly manipulative. The presence of additional security â€” again, required because of threats â€” did slow entry onto the Capitol lawn and the Mall. (How easy the left often has it: threaten Republicans, then mock them in the media for taking you seriously!) Most Trump fans were probably happy to see Spicer take the media to task â€” especially over the false report that President Trump had removed a bust of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. from the Oval Office. That bogus story was undoubtedly motivated by the media\\'s continued quest to find evidence of racism in the Trump camp. It was classic fake news, a clean bust (no pun intended). So, naturally, media critics focused on the more dubious claim that Trump\\'s crowds had rivaled Obama\\'s. To make his case, Spicer presented what Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway later called \"alternative facts\" â€” a harmless, and accurate, term in a legal setting, where each side of a dispute will lay out its own version of the facts for the court to decide. In the heated debate, however, the term quickly became a meme as a euphemism for \"lying\" â€” in much the way that a Bush aide inadvertently gave the mainstream media a badge of honor when he used the phrase \" community. \" Trump was not lying â€” nor were Spicer, or Conway. They were merely giving their version of events. But CNN and the New York Times explicitly said that Trump had made \"false\" claims, whether about crowd size or the media, even when his claims were clearly supportable opinion. It was not enough for journalists to find, and report, the facts independently, and let their readers or viewers decide. They decided to be argumentative â€” and laid down a marker, \"Trump lied,\" on Day One (or Two). In some ways, that was simply the media reverting to what they had done under the Bush administration, the last time they had to cover a Republican in power. We are likely to hear a lot more about \"alternative facts\" in the future, stripped of its original (benign) context and used as the foundation for an alternative reality. There is nothing even Trump can do to stop that. But the new administration could choose its battles more carefully, and perhaps learn to deliver rebukes with a smile. Joel B.

              " 'The United States is crafting a plan for a drawdown of staff from the American embassy in Havana in response to still-unexplained incidents that have harmed the health of some U.S. diplomats there, U.S. and congressional officials said on Thursday. The State Department\\'s plan, which was being finalized and could be announced within days, would call for the departure of non-essential staff and diplomats\\' families, the sources said. But it was unclear whether leaving the island would be voluntary or compulsory, and one U.S. official said some details were still being worked out. U.S. officials say 21 U.S. diplomats and family members have been afflicted by health problems of unknown origin, including hearing loss, dizziness and nausea. Several Canadians have also been affected in Cuba, a Canadian official has said. The Cuban government has denied any role and is conducting an investigation. But it has so far said it has been unable to determine the cause. Proposals for a drawdown have moved forward since U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the case, which has been threatening the already fragile detente between the two former Cold War foes. The State Department is expected to stop short of saying it will close the recently reopened embassy because of the mysterious affair, despite Tillerson having said last week that such a move was under consideration. But a partial evacuation, even one depicted by the Trump administration as a safety measure, would also send a message of U.S. displeasure over Cuba\\'s handling of the matter and deliver another blow to Obama-era engagement policies with Havana. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters Thursday that Tillerson â€“ who is now on his way to Beijing - was reviewing all of his options for \"how to best protect our American personnel\" in Cuba and that she was not ready to announce any decision. But congressional staffers were briefed on the plan on Thursday, two congressional sources said. Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a harsh critic of the Cuban government, hinted at the State Department\\'s coming decision. \"Any reduction of Americans from @USEmbassyHavana should also require equal number of Castro employees leaving regime\\'s embassy in U.S.,\" he said in a message on Twitter. The State Department declined comment. McClatchy news service was the first to report this week that the United States would soon begin a major withdrawal of Havana staff. Depending on how many diplomats leave, the Havana embassy â€“ the main point of contact for U.S. citizens visiting the island as well as American companies doing business there â€“ could be left with more of a skeletal staff to handle responsibilities. Though Washington has not cast direct blame on Cuban authorities, the State Department said Tillerson reminded Rodriguez at Tuesday\\'s meeting of Cuba\\'s obligation to protect diplomats and their families. In the highest-level U.S.-Cuba meeting since President Donald Trump took office, Rodriguez warned the United States against taking hasty decisions and urged Washington to cooperate with its ongoing investigation. Washington earlier this year expelled two Cuban diplomats over the alleged incidents. The case has brought simmering tensions between the two countries since Trump took office to the boil. Trump, who in June vowed to partially roll back the detente with Cuba agreed by his Democratic predecessor, President Barack Obama, called the Cuban government \"corrupt and destabilizing\" in his address to the United Nations General Assembly last week. He said he would not lift the U.S. trade embargo on the Caribbean island until it made \"fundamental reforms.\" Cuba described his comments as \"unacceptable and meddling.\"',\n",
              " 'French President Emmanuel Macron s government announced reforms to loosen labor regulations and drive down unemployment, drawing criticism from unions but limited support for the street protests that have hindered previous reform bids. After weeks of negotiations with unions over the summer, the centrist government revealed measures including a cap on payouts for dismissals adjudged unfair and greater freedom to hire and fire. The plan would also give companies more flexibility to adapt pay and working hours to market conditions. The labor code reform is the first big test of Macron s drive to re-shape the euro zone s second biggest economy with its near double-digit jobless rate, double that in Britain and markedly higher than Germany. He also seeks a grand bargain with Germany over broader reforms of the euro zone. For decades, governments of the left and right have tried to reform France s strict labor rules, but have always diluted them in the face of street protests. The reform makes no direct reference to France s 35-hour week but gives employers more flexibility to negotiate deals with employees to work around it. Labour Minister Muriel Penicaud described the five decrees laying out the reforms as a transformation of labor rules on an unprecedented scale . Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said they were necessary to fight France s stubbornly high unemployment. The truth is that for bosses, especially of small companies, and foreign investors, the existing labor law is seen as a brake on hiring and investment, Philippe said. Trade unions were less upbeat at what they perceived as the loss of long-cherished workers rights. All of our fears have been confirmed, said Philippe Martinez, head of the hard-left CGT union, after the government presented the decrees to unions and employers. He said the union would press ahead with its plan for a protest on Sept. 12. But Macron s assiduous courting of the unions over the summer appeared to have born fruit. France s biggest union, the reformist CFDT, said it was disappointed with what amounted to a missed opportunity to improve labor relations. But both the CFDT and the smaller Force Ouvriere, one of the spearheads of last year s anti-reform protests, said they would not be joining the CGT s protest. This reform does not rise to the occasion , CFDT leader Laurent Berger told reporters, but he added: Taking to the streets is not the only mode of action for unions. It sets a cap on compensation for a dismissal judged in a labor court to be unfair. This will be set at three months of wages for two years in the company with the amount rising progressively depending on how long a worker was with the firm. In a concession to unions, normal severance pay would be increased from 20 percent of one month s wage for each year in a company to 25 percent. Economists drew parallels with Germany and Spain. This very much resembles the labor reform carried out in Germany in 2004-2005, said Florian Hense, European economist at Berenberg Bank. This could very well propel France to a golden decade like Germany had. Dutch bank ING said: The ceiling on dismissal compensation is a milestone in labor flexibility and a real positive for permanent contract creation. In Spain, a similar reform kick-started an unprecedented labor market recovery. Pierre Gattaz, the head of the MEDEF employers federation, described the reforms as an important first step which would boost confidence within companies. The CPME, a small business lobby, was even more positive. At last!, it said in a statement. After months of negotiations, we got results. The reform we had been waiting for so long is there. The labor reforms comes as the 39-year-old president suffers a steep drop in popularity ratings. Early policy announcements including an overhaul of the wealth tax and cuts to housing assistance have left a swathe of voters feeling his policies favor the rich, pollsters say. The government plans to start talks on overhauling unemployment benefits in October before tackling pension reform next year. Parliament, where Macron s Republic on the Move party has a commanding majority, has already voted to allow the government to issue the decrees without a vote in the assembly. The government plans to adopt the decrees on Sept. 22.',\n",
              " 'A dam in Puerto Rico weakened by heavy rains from Hurricane Maria was in danger of failing on Sunday, posing a flood threat to thousands of homes downstream as the storm-battered U.S. island territory struggled through a fifth day with virtually no electricity. Some 70,000 people who inhabit a river valley below the Guajataca Dam in the northwestern corner of the island have been under evacuation orders since Friday afternoon, when authorities first warned that the earthen structure was in danger of imminent collapse. The fear of a potentially catastrophic dam break added to the pandemonium facing disaster relief authorities in the aftermath of Maria, which has claimed at least 29 lives across the Caribbean, according to officials and media reports. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello personally urged residents of the area to heed evacuation orders after surveying damage to the dam on Saturday, telling reporters that a fissure in the structure has become a significant rupture. The dam, which stands about 120 feet (37 meters) tall, was built in 1929 and supplies the surrounding region with hydropower, drinking water and irrigation supplies. The National Weather Service in San Juan, the island s capital, extended a flash flood watch for communities along the rain-swollen Guajataca River below the dam through midday Sunday. If the dam were to fail, flooding would be life-threatening, the Weather Service warned. Stay away or be swept away, it said. Maria, the second major hurricane to savage the Caribbean this month and the most powerful to strike Puerto Rico in nearly a century, carved a path of destruction through the island after plowing ashore early on Wednesday. Arriving as a Category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson wind scale, with top winds of up to 155 mph (249.5 kph), Maria ripped roofs from buildings, turned roads into gushing debris-strewn rivers and knocked out power across the entire island, home to 3.4 million people. We lost our house, it was completely flooded, said resident Carmen Gloria Lamb, a resident near the rain-swollen Guajataca. We lost everything; cars, clothes, everything. Puerto Rico officials have officially confirmed 10 storm-related fatalities on the island, and the hurricane was blamed for at least 19 other deaths across the Caribbean, the bulk of them on the devastated island nation of Dominica. Severe flooding, structural damage to homes and the loss of all electricity, except from backup generators, were three of the most pressing problems facing Puerto Ricans, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose state is home to many of Puerto Rican descent, said during a tour of the island. It s a terrible immediate situation that requires assistance from the federal government, not just financial assistance, he said on CNN on Saturday. Even the island s medical facilities have been left in precarious shape, with many hospitals flooded, strewn with rubble and running critically low on diesel fuel needed to keep generators operating. Evacuation to the U.S. mainland is the only option for some patients. Signs of the strain on Puerto Ricans were evident throughout San Juan, the capital. Drivers had to wait up to seven hours at the few filling stations open on Saturday, according to news reports. Water rationing also began on Saturday. Signs posted throughout San Juan s Old Town informed residents that service would return for two hours until further notice. Telephone service also was unreliable, with many of the island s cell towers damaged or destroyed. On Sunday morning, the governor told reporters that officials would continue to clear roads and bridges blocked by the storm and that he would be joining a supply delivery mission to Caguas, a small city in the mountains south of San Juan. The storm caused an estimated $45 billion of damage and lost economic activity across the Caribbean, with at least $30 billion of that in Puerto Rico, said Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler at Enki Research in Savannah, Georgia. Maria, which was hundreds of miles (km) east of Florida over the Atlantic Ocean on Sunday, has been downgraded to a Category 2 storm and was expected to weaken further as it moves north in the Atlantic off the East Coast over the next two days. Maria hit Puerto Rico about two weeks after Hurricane Irma, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms on record, killed more than 80 people in the Caribbean and the United States. The two storms followed Hurricane Harvey, which also killed more than 80 people when it struck Texas in late August and caused flooding in Houston.',\n",
              " 'Two women accused of murdering the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un with a banned nerve agent pleaded not guilty at the start of a high-profile murder trial in a Malaysian court on Monday. Indonesian Siti Aisyah, 25, and Doan Thi Huong, 28, a Vietnamese, are charged with killing Kim Jong Nam by smearing his face with VX, a chemical poison banned by the United Nations, at Kuala Lumpur airport on Feb. 13. Both women wore bullet-proof vests as they were led into the court on the outskirts of the Malaysian capital. They face the death penalty if convicted. Police have also named four North Koreans as suspects in the case and an Interpol red notice, an international alert just short of an arrest warrant, has been issued for the North Koreans, who remain at large. Defence lawyers demanded that the prosecution immediately name the four other suspects, who have also been charged, so they can prepare their case. The charge must be clear, said Siti Aisyah s lawyer, Gooi Soon Seng. Judge Azmi Ariffin dismissed their request. The two women nodded their heads when the charges were read out by two interpreters. They pleaded not guilty. The prosecution said the women s actions showed intent to kill the victim by smearing his face and eyes with VX nerve agent, which a Malaysian post-mortem confirmed had killed Kim. The women told their lawyers they did not know they were participating in a deadly attack and believed they were carrying out a prank for a reality TV show. The prank practice carried out by the first and second accused with the supervision of the four who are still at large was preparation to see through their common intention to kill the victim, lead prosecutor Muhamad Iskandar Ahmad said in his opening statement. The two women sat quietly in the packed courtroom. Siti was dressed in a black floral suit, while Huong wore a white long-sleeved t-shirt and jeans. Juliana Idris, who works at the airport, told the court a man later identified as Kim Jong Nam approached her and asked her to take him to a police station. She said the man, who spoke English, told her he had been attacked by a woman from behind ... another one closed his eyes . His hands were shaking a bit, I don t know why, she said. Police Lance Corporal Mohd Zulkarnain Sanudin, who was on duty at the airport, said Juliana had brought Kim Jong Nam to him. He said Kim told him a substance had been wiped on his face. Kim s eyes were red and he could see some liquid on his face, Zulkarnain said. He also said the he had wrongly recorded Kim Jong Nam s nationality as South Korean. The police report I made showed the nationality as South Korean, while on the passport, it was written DPR Korea, whereby I did not know what DPR meant. I was only sure that Korea was South Korea, he told the court. DPRK are the initials for North Korea s official name, the Democratic Republic of North Korea. Other witnesses described how Kim Jong Nam had seizures at the clinic - his eyes rolled upwards and there was drooling of saliva and mucus. Rabiatul Adawiyah Mohd Sofi, a medical assistant, said Kim Jong Nam was at the clinic for just over an hour and moved to a hospital. By the time they arrived at the hospital emergency ward, they could not get a blood pressure reading, she said. There was a high probability that there was either a problem with our monitor or the patient had died, said Rabiatul. The case continues on Tuesday.',\n",

(I\\'m not sending this e-mail to make you angry or upset you just to get a better understanding.) Let me get my questions: 1.) I hear much about \"our\" White race \"dying\" or disappearing is this true? If so what stats do you have suggesting this? 2.) Why do you wear the Brown shirts of the SA when Hitler disbanned the SA? Why not black the color of the SS? 3.) I myself have many sympathies for Adolf Hitler I understand he is your \"official leader\" but why do you respect him after saying such things as - \"How fortunate for leaders that men do not think.\" Does this quote not sound like he is in essence trying to \"slide something under the rug\" by saying that if you lie to the people you can get away with pretty much anything? If i\\'m wrong I would appreciate it if you would correct me. : ) 4.) What do you think about the black race? Do you view that the White race is superior to them? If so why? Do you believe that they should live in the U.S.? 5.) If we are indeed superior to every other race, what kinds of things make \"us\" (The White Race) superior? 6.) I also see the word \"Nature\" used with a capital \"N\" what is this \"Nature?\" 7.) I already know your stance on interacial marriage but, why is it that it is bad? (Do not dogs interbreed and you get different breeds.) What is different about this and the human race? 8.) Is our race truly in that much danger that we should not \"interbreed?\" What is it about this that is so important? 9.) Did Hitler believe that the White race/German race should not breed with Jews/Blacks more importantly? Jeff I hope I\\'m not asking you too much too quickly and I would greatly appreciate it if you could return my e-mail.

              " 'Email  Chambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne announced that all early voting in the county was once again on the iVotronic machines after one day of early voting using paper ballots. The emergency usage of paper ballots took place on Tuesday, October 25 while a software problem was being resolved. The vendor corrected the problem and reinstalled the corrected configuration in time for all ballots the next day, according to Hawthorne in a press release on October 27.  The situation was recounted by ABC 12 News: An error in the voting machine programming by Election Systems & Software (ES&S) caused votes for one statewide court of appeals race not to be entered when a voter tried to vote straight ticket in either party according to a release from Chambers County.  Chambers County, Texas, is a small county, having only 13 precincts and only four early-voting locations. County Clerk Heather Hawthorne told The New American 1,801 ballots were cast before switching to the paper ballots. Some of those 1,801 voters were warned to double check their ballots due to the software glitch. Because Chambers County is a Republican stronghold, the Republican candidate will be more adversely affected than the Democratic candidate by unintended under-votes. The question is how many unintended under-votes were there for these candidates and how close will that contest be?  There was a similar ballot problem in 2010 in Travis County, Texas, although the 2010 error was made on the paper ballots. A number of military absentee voters who were bona fide Texas residents were accidentally sent ballots for federal overseas voters. The ballots for federal overseas voters did not include local contests, such as ones for the Texas House of Representatives, and it was impossible to vote for that contest using the ballots provided. Republican Dan Neil lost by 16 votes. The final vote total was Donna Howard (D) 25,026, Dan Neil (R) 25,010 and Ben Easton (L) 1,518. Neil challenged the election total for a number of reasons, in addition to the ballot format, but the Texas Legislature, even though it was supposedly solidly Republican, seated Howard even though a very common practice in such close elections is to seat neither candidate, pay both candidates, and give both candidates equal access to the building and caucuses while the dispute is resolved or a new election is called.  In this case in Chambers County, the affected contest is a judicial contest. Hopefully, it will not be as close as the House District 48 race in 2010.  The voters who were affected by the Chambers County computer glitch were fortunate the errors were obvious enough for voters to notice and bring to the attention of the election officials. How many errors go undetected because they are not obvious to the voters or the election processes are not transparent? Errors such as this serve as a reminder of how important it is that voting have a paper trail and be a transparent process with plenty of paper documentation in case it becomes necessary to reconstruct precinct vote totals or other vital election records.

              " 'You are here: Home / political cartoon / What Marketing Obamacare Really Looks Like [Cartoon] What Marketing Obamacare Really Looks Like [Cartoon] October 28, 2016 Pinterest  C.E. Dyer reports that the disaster that is Obamacare is about to get worse for many people enrolled in the health insurance marketplace. On Monday, the Obama administration confirmed that premiums will skyrocket for many people next year, according to the Associated Press .  The AP reported:  Before taxpayer-provided subsidies, premiums for a midlevel benchmark plan will increase an average of 25 percent across the 39 states served by the federally run online market, according to a report from the Department of Health and Human Services. Some states will see much bigger jumps, others less.  Moreover, about 1 in 5 consumers will only have plans from a single insurer to pick from, after major national carriers such as UnitedHealth Group, Humana and Aetna scaled back their roles.  In some states, the premium increases are striking. In Arizona, unsubsidized premiums for a hypothetical 27-year-old buying a benchmark \"second-lowest cost silver plan\" will jump by 116 percent, from $196 to $422, according to the administration report.  But HHS said if that hypothetical consumer has a fairly modest income, making $25,000 a year, the subsidies would cover $280 of the new premium, and the consumer would pay $142. Caveat: if the consumer is making $30,000 or $40,000 his or her subsidy would be significantly lower.  Larry Levitt, who follows the health care law for the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, said of the increases: \"Consumers will be faced this year with not only big premium increases but also with a declining number of insurers participating, and that will lead to a tumultuous open enrollment period.\"  Donald Trump\\'s campaign spokesman, Jason Miller, said in a statement on Monday: \"This shows why the entire program must be repealed and replaced.\" Miller added, \"While (Hillary) Clinton wants to expand the failed program known as Obamacare, Mr. Trump knows the only way to fix our nation\\'s failing health care system is complete and total reform.\"  Reports have warned that this was coming down the pike for some time; however, HHS\\'s confirmation ahead of open enrollment beginning Nov. 1 â€” one week before the election â€” is likely to cause major headaches for many people.  This debacle is not unexpected either â€” it\\'s exactly what President Obama and Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton wanted to happen.  Obamacare was never the end goal. Rather, it was a stepping stone toward single-payer, government-run healthcare. That is a big reason why Obama wants Clinton to become president â€” his legacy is at stake.  Obama\\'s legacy is largely wrapped up in Obamacare and what it leads to. Clinton tried to push this first step during her time as first lady and failed, but the conditions will be ripe for her to go even further should she be elected.  If Clinton becomes president, there\\'s no doubt that her next step will be to move to single-payer healthcare. Obamacare is bad, there\\'s no doubt about it, but single-payer government healthcare would be even worse.',\n",
              " 'If ever there was a reminder that Sen. Ted Cruz is NOT the Republican Party s reasonable alternative to Donald Trump, it s in his response to the Brussels terror attacks. Losing badly to Trump, Cruz is clearly feeling the pressure to capitalize on the tragedy to win some crucial votes so he s gone all in on xenophobia, totalitarianism, and religious persecution. A hate cocktail sure to fire up his base.In a statement he released on Facebook, Cruz calls for the establishment of ghettos where America s Muslims can be contained and watched over by a specialized law enforcement group meant to police them. If that sounds a little to Nazi-esque for you, Cruz preemptively accused his critics of just being too politically correct to agree with him.Here s Cruz s terrifying vision for his presidency:We need to immediately halt the flow of refugees from countries with a significant al Qaida or ISIS presence.We need to empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized.We need to secure the southern border to prevent terrorist infiltration.And we need to execute a coherent campaign to utterly destroy ISIS.In other words, Cruz is plagiarizing Trump s ban all Muslims position, but adding that the Muslims already in the country should be secured in specific neighborhoods before they become radicalized. He doesn t bother clarifying how he would hope to accomplish this. Nor does he mention how he could legally target Muslims who had done nothing wrong just because his prejudice tells him they might some day.Being Lying Ted Cruz, he also couldn t help but spread a little misinformation about President Obama as well. Using the president s historic trip to Cuba as a strawman, Cruz bashed him for being on a diplomatic trip while Brussels was attacked, adding that Obama never visited Paris after the terror attacks there. It was an egregious lie, so shameless that a simple picture could debunk it.#COP21 Paying respect : President Obama & French President Hollande lay flowers at Bataclan concert hall in Paris. pic.twitter.com/YEMy7ZUDvk Catherine Field (@CatherineField) November 30, 2015Needless to say, Muslim activist groups, who have watched in horror as hate crimes directed at Muslim Americans has steadily grown thanks to people like Cruz, were not amused by this latest call to trounce the Constitution based on hate and fear. It s really beyond belief that you have one of the leading presidential candidates calling for law enforcement to target religious communities totally based on the fact that they are of a particular faith, CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper said by phone. In normal times, this would be the sort of thing that would disqualify someone from running for dogcatcher, much less president of the United States. We call on voters to reject this.Undoubtedly, terrorism is a serious problem. But the solutions to it need to be much more mature than the Republicans seem to want to believe. Totalitarianism doesn t work and never has. Discriminating against innocent Muslims because of a twisted death cult based in the Middle East is not only doomed to fail, but could backfire in ways that Cruz and Trump can t fathom from their build a wall childish ideology.Between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, it s hard to say who the bigger xenophobic bigot is. Both are consumed by a hatred towards scapegoated groups they hope to exploit in order to ensure people vote for them. At this point in the race, the two Republican frontrunners aren t just mirroring each other s disgusting policies, but actually driving one another to make them more abhorrent. A nuclear arms race of bigotry in a crucial moment in America s history.',\n",
              " \"When I saw Meryl Streep play the seemingly facile Omaha housewife she portrays in this 2012 marital dramedy, I had an immediate flashback to an underrated romantic drama she did almost thirty years ago, Ulu Grosbard's (1984), in which she played a young married woman who couldn't help falling for a married architect (Robert De Niro) on a commuter train. I kept thinking of Kay as that earlier character all these years later trying to fan the embers of the passion that erupted so unpredictably back then. Interestingly, her younger character could not consummate the affair either but fell hopelessly in love anyway. Director David Frankel () and first-time screenwriter Vanessa Taylor travel to the opposite end of the marital spectrum, a 31-year-old marriage that finds Kay and her accountant husband Arnold sleeping in separate bedrooms having long ago lost any sense of intimacy and passion their marriage once had. The film begins with a seriocomic preface in which Kay awkwardly tries to seduce Arnold, an invitation he rebuffs with the flimsiest of excuses. Knowing their marriage is on auto-pilot, she fears being alone emotionally and ending their lives in emotional isolation now as they go through the motions in their sixties. An optimist despite the odds, Kay signs them up for a week of intensive couples therapy in Great Hope Springs, Maine, where renowned therapist Dr. Bernie Feld practices. Arnold is predictably resistant but begrudgingly accompanies her when he realizes how serious Kay is about the counseling. The sessions with Dr. Feld initially don't go well with Arnold protesting the doctor's every recommendation for building intimacy in his relationship with Kay. This is when the movie becomes the most surprising because every time a physically awkward moment presents itself, the feelings become heartfelt and sometimes humorous in unexpected ways. While Frankel and Taylor handle the slim story turns with genuine insight, it's the masterful work of Streep and Tommy Lee Jones that elevates the film into an experience that far transcends the Lifetime-TV orientation you would expect otherwise. Unafraid to come across as harshly judgmental, Jones has made a career of playing dyspeptic curmudgeons, so it's nice to see him gradually reveal Arnold's vulnerabilities with skill and delicacy. He has to play Arnold close to the vest but not so insular as to make you wonder what Kay saw in him in the first place. After tackling larger-than-life figures like Julia Child and Margaret Thatcher, Streep is splendid portraying a sheltered woman who contributes as much to the fossilized, inchoate marriage as Arnold does. At 63, the actress allows herself to look even beyond her age, but she's still beautiful in a shopworn way. I love how she almost swallows every word she speaks as if Kay's tentative nature is holding back grand expectations of a romance she can only fantasize about. The two veteran actors have a natural rapport that gives the viewer a rooting interest in seeing them overcome their age-old emotional and physical barriers. There are moments between them especially in the film's last third that are quite heartbreaking, especially when they come to learn that they aren't the people they believed themselves, or each other, to be. Steve Carell plays Feld straight-up without an iota of irony, and his clinical approach works effectively within this context. The rest of the supporting cast makes very little impact, including Jean Smart as Kay's sassy manager at the Coldwater Creek she works part-time, Elisabeth Shue as an equally sassy barmaid counseling Kay on sex, and Mimi Rogers as the final payoff of a joke about a comely (and yes, sassy) neighbor with a trio of corgis. The young actors who play Kay and Arnold's adult children are barely present, but I'm sure that was part of the intention in order to allow complete focus on the couple. Frankel overdoes the soundtrack music when moments of silence would have been far more effective, but otherwise, the tone feels spot-on.\",\n",
              " 'It s hard to be famous for being a victim in an Arab Gulf state who settles their disputes in a Sharia Court of Law. Someone should have told Clock Boy that being a victim in a country where victims are plentiful isn t really that special. Unlike America, being accused of bringing a fake bomb to school in Qatar isn t likely a guarantee you ll land a visit with their King.Within days of demanding a total of $15 million from the City of Irving and the Irving Independent School District, Clock Boy Ahmed Mohamed announced in a long distance phone interview from Qatar, he is homesick and wants to come home to Texas now.In October, Ahmed accepted a fully-funded education scholarship from the Qatar Foundation, an organization with reputed ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, over an invitation to MIT, which is among the most prestigious institutions of higher learning in the world. The family announced they would relocate to Qatar to accommodate his education, which they did.Happy #Thanksgiving!! Ahmed Mohamed (@IStandWithAhmed) November 26, 2015Dallas KTVT 11 (CBS) interviewed the teen from halfway around the world over Facetime. Now, Ahmed claims he misses Texas. I want to go back to a place where everyone knows me, meaning the kids he grew up with. He also hinted a trip to Dallas may be in the works over the Christmas holiday. He told the CBS affiliate he is ready to come home and wants to do so immediately, but insists last week s armed yet peaceful protest outside the Irving mosque stopped him.Breitbart Texas reported on the small group outside of the Islamic Center of Irving. The organizer released dozens of names and addresses considered Muslim and Muslim sympathizers over social media. The list, however, was posted on the City of Irving s website since March with the information of those who signed up to speak for and against the topic of American laws for American courts at an Irving city council meeting.Ahmed told the TV news outlet: I was scared because I ve heard what happened recently with, like, people with guns going to my local mosque, adding: I mean, they have the right to do that but it s scary because I m afraid, you know. Last week, through West Texas attorney Kelly Hollingsworth, Ahmed s family demanded $15 million plus apologies in letters that asserted they moved to the Middle East because threats and fear drove his family from Texas. However, Irving Mayor Beth Van Duyne received serious online threats and remains under fire over decisions made by the Irving ISD and Irving police to detain the high school freshman, who, on Sept. 14, brought into school a makeshift clock that resembled a briefcase bomb.The KTVT reporter pointed out that questioning the teen about the $15 million was something that nearly ended (the interview). He captured Ahmed s metered responses with eyes drifting off camera that appeared to look offside for approval from someone before answering questions. Ahmed first looked away when asked if he wanted to come back to Texas before answering yes with a smile. Clock Boy then told the CBS affiliate he was waiting for people to calm down back home before he returned.In a Christmas season blanketed by the Islamic State attacks in Paris, State Department travel alerts, and Syrian refugees at U.S. borders, sympathy continues to wane for the Islamophobia poster child. Breitbart News reported that the same liberal media that championed the teen s every move, including his Qatar Foundation-sponsored tour of Education City, lost interest.The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette added what little sympathy Americans had for the Clock Boy is gone thanks to a shameless money grab by the teen s family. The newspaper added that the Mohamed family s departure and subsequent demands make them look like opportunists, or worse.',\n",
              " 'The sad fact is my hair, like many women, is thinning and becoming more delicate as I get older. This is an issue in part because I like it at a below-shoulder length (just keeps so many options open for how to wear it). I have been looking for a shampoo and conditioner that will help my hair be healthier and appear a bit more full. Toward this goal I had been using for decades, but they changed the formula and now it is terrible. I came across Biolage Fortetherapie Strengthening Conditioner while searching for a good replacement for my old-formula conditioner and (which had a scent I didn\\'t like and led to a strange incident covered in that review). I replaced the shampoo with which seems a set with Fortetherapie conditioner. I\\'ve tried several other conditioners that were not really satisfactory and some just not acceptable. Fortetherapie was like a breath of fresh air and left my hair feeling very nice. The scent is very mild and sort of like bamboo. It is almost no scent which pleases me. With my below shoulder hair I used dollop about between the size of a nickel and a quarter then rub my hands together and work it throughout my hair. This amount seems to work well and helps make it easier to get my shower comb through my wet hair. It\\'s not really a detangling conditioner for me, but it helps a lot and that is plenty good for me. Rinsing it out takes longer than I expected. Hotter water helps clear it faster but too-hot may not be good for hair or scalp. I\\'m slowly trying to use less and less till I hit the right balance. The bottom line is using and Fortetherapie Strenthening conditioner is leaving my hair and scalp feeling and looking better than I expected. My hair looks and feels clean longer and is very manageable. I\\'ll update the review with observations about the \"strengthening\" properties as I live with Fortetherapie conditioner longer. First impressions are very positive and hopeful. I hope this will be helpful, especially for those of us who loved the original formula Nexxus Humectress conditioner. Update: Jan 9 2014 Because of the rinsing issue I mentioned in the main review I have been using less and less of the Biolage conditioner each shampoo. I\\'m now using about half what I started with and it rinses easier and my hair looks and feels at least as nice. What I\\'m using now seems less than what I would have thought would be effective. But happy surprise: it\\'s like getting twice as many shampoos for the same money. It seems like my Biolage conditioner keeps getting better and better. Update: Feb 15 2015 I think I\\'m using a little less than in the January update. A little less than a rounded nickel sized blob. This seems about right for my below shoulder length hair. I also can risse this amount more easily without resorting to very hot water. After a couple of months I feel my hair is either stronger or less likely to tangle and break. Whatever the case I got the same positive result. Matrix Biolage Strengthening conditioner exceeds my original expectation even more now.',\n",
              " 'Food Stamp use has miraculously gone down in several states! It s a miracle! In 13 Alabama counties, food stamp use went down a whopping 85%!When Obama took out the welfare-to-work requirement, the use of food stamps skyrocketed to nearly 45 million Americans! That s 1 in every 7 US citizens using food stamps! Now that the Trump administration has vowed to reduce the use, it s interesting to see that people jump off of assistance when the work requirement is put back in.Georgia and Alabama have seen a sharp decrease in food stamp use with the work requirement back in:Georgia:More than half of the 11,779 people enrolled for food stamps in 21 counties, an estimated 7,251 people, have dropped out of the food stamp program a drop of 62 percent, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.Georgia first rolled out its work requirements for the food stamp program in three counties in January 2016. Since then, the state has expanded work requirements in an additional 21 counties, giving people in those 21 counties until April 1, 2017 to find a job or lose food stamp benefits. Via: BNALABAMA:Thirteen previously exempted Alabama counties saw an 85 percent drop in food stamp participation after work requirements were put in place on Jan. 1, according to the Alabama Department of Human Resources.The counties Greene, Hale, Perry, Dallas, Lowndes, Wilcox, Monroe, Conecuh, Clarke, Washington, Choctaw, Sumter and Barbour had been exempt from a change that limited able-bodied adults without dependents to three months of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits within a three-year time frame unless they were working or participating in an approved training program.During the economic downturn of 2011-2013, several states including Alabama waived the SNAP work requirements in response to high unemployment. It was reinstituted for 54 counties on Jan. 1, 2016 and for the remaining 13 on Jan. 1, 2017. As of April 2017, the highest jobless rate among the 13 previously excluded counties was in Wilcox County, which reported a state-high unemployment rate of 11.7 percent, down more than 11 percentage points from the county s jobless rate for the same month of 2011.Ending the exemption has dramatically cut the number of SNAP recipients in the counties.As of Jan. 1, 2017, there were 13,663 able-bodied adults without dependents receiving food stamps statewide. That number dropped to 7,483 by May 1, 2017. Among the 13 counties, there were 5,538 adults ages 18-50 without dependents receiving food stamps as of Jan. 1, 2017. That number dropped to 831 a decline of about 85 percent by May 1, 2017. Based on the trend, the number of (able-bodied adults without dependents) recipients for SNAP benefits is expected to continue to decline statewide and in the formerly 13 exempted counties, according to Alabama DHR spokesperson John Hardy.Statewide, the number of able-bodied adults receiving food stamps has fallen by almost 35,000 people since Jan. 1, 2016. Each recipient receives about $126 a month in benefits.Nationwide, there are about 44 million people receiving SNAP benefits at a cost of about $71 billion. The Trump administration has vowed to cut the food stamp rolls over the next decade, including ensuring that able-bodied adults recipients are working.',\n",
              " 'At a Donald Trump rally in North Carolina, a proud Ginger Glover waved a \"Lyin\\' Hillary Doll\" with a special edition noose on it.  Watch a clip with Glover at the Wednesday rally here via NBC News :  Glover said the noose was her way of making a point that Hillary Clinton should be \"incarcerated at the very least,\" but when asked said she doesn\\'t think Clinton should be killed.  Yet her employees put the noose on the doll for her and she brought it out in public and waved it around. For \"effect.\"  Where is all of the Trump rallies\\' violent rhetoric and imagery going?  Donald Trump seems to attract people who are angry and want someone to blame.  The Washington Post did an incredible story on Melanie Austin, a Trump supporter who said Trump sees the world like she does. She realized this days after she had been injected with something intended to \"calm\" her, after she was involuntarily committed for homicidal ideation against President Obama.  The first time she had seen him, at a rally in June, she was just beginning to realize how many people saw the world the way she did, that she was one among millions. At the time, her hips were still sore from a series of injections intended to calm her. She had gotten them in February, during a difficult time in her life, when she had been involuntarily hospitalized for several weeks after what she called a \"rant,\" a series of online postings that included one saying that Obama should be hanged and the White House fumigated and burned to the ground. On her discharge papers, in a box labeled \"medical problem,\" a doctor had typed \"homicidal ideation.\"  Donald Trump and the alt-right, and indeed way too many elected Republicans, have already pointed these folks at Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama as Evil People Who Must Be Harmed. When you attract unstable people who are easily manipulated out of anger and fear and then direct them to harm someone, as Trump and his advisers have done suggesting Hillary Clinton might be shot and saying she should be executed with a firing squad, you are responsible for inciting violence.  Things are not going well for Trump supporters, and even buoyed as they are with unscientific online polls and delusions fed by the alt-right media and Fox News, they smell defeat.  Perhaps that\\'s not connected to this specific woman who brought a Hillary Clinton doll in a noose to wave at a Trump rally last night, but it is a trend we\\'re seeing in general â€“ angry Trump fans using more and more violent rhetoric.  There will be more of this, not less, as Trump\\'s likely defeat becomes reality outside of tinfoil circles.  This is political intimidation that mimics Donald Trump\\'s despotic promises to jail Clinton even though she\\'s been cleared of wrong-doing in all of the relentless Republican investigations into her activities as Secretary of State.  Of which there will be plenty more, Republicans promise us, should she win â€” because just like the Trump camp doesn\\'t want you to vote, Republicans only want government to work when they\\'re not in power.  The potent mixture of tinfoil and rage is creating a toxic brew of violent fantasies and rhetoric among Trump supporters.  Image: Screencap from NBC News video',\n",
              " 'Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr  Voter fraud has been on the minds of Republicans for a while now. It has been proven that while yes, there are isolated incidences of in-person voter fraud, there has never been a case where it was so rampant that it changed the results of an election. But that\\'s exactly what the GOP wants you to think is going on.  Donald Trump took Republican rhetoric about voter fraud and has ramped it up to an entirely new level, claiming that the upcoming election is going to be \"rigged.\" Apparently, Republicans are in on this alleged rigging along with Democrats, since a number of the states where the vote looks to be close are controlled by the GOP. And as everyone outside of Trump\\'s basket of deplorables knows, election mechanics are handled by the states, not the federal government.  How are Trump\\'s supporters reacting to all of his claims about voter fraud? Well, in at least one case the answer to that question is \"By committing voter fraud themselves.\"  Terri Lynn Rote, 55, an Iowa Trump supporter, has been charged with \"election misconduct,\" which is a Class D felony in the state. According to Iowa Public Radio, Rote allegedly voted for Trump twice when she cast her ballot during early voting. And her reason? She was afraid that her first vote would be changed to a vote for Hillary Clinton, so she voted again. The Des Moines Register reports that Rote voted once at the Polk County elections office , then again at a county satellite polling location.  Rote told Iowa Public Radio,  \"I wasn\\'t planning on doing it twice, it was spur of the moment. The polls are rigged.\"  According to the Register, Rote\\'s case was one of three voter fraud cases that occurred in Polk County alone. The other two incidents involved people who voted on mail-in ballots, then voted again in person. Polk County auditor Jamie Fitzgerald says this is the first time in his 12 years in office he has had to deal with even one case of voter fraud, let alone three. There are no details about who the other two suspects cast ballots for. The sad thing is, polls have been saying for weeks that Trump is going to win Iowa. Cases like this might put his win there in question, which would be a perfect example of poetic justice.  This is what the rhetoric about voter fraud has come t0 â€” people attempting to vote multiple times because they\\'re convinced that their chosen candidate is going to be cheated out of a legitimate win. Republicans, unwilling to accept that their policies are being rejected by a larger and larger segment of the U.S. population, are trying to sell the message that elections are being stolen from the GOP by \"massive\" voter fraud. Yet, time after time, it seems to be Republicans who are committing the lion\\'s share of it. They claim to love the country, but Trump and the GOP are deliberately undermining the foundation of a democracy â€” the integrity of the vote. Next, Trump will claim that people like Terri Rote are \"political prisoners.\" Just wait for it.',\n",
              " 'I really, really want to give the Lego Falcon a five star rating. It is by far my favorite ship in all the Star Wars movies, and the Lego model is a near perfect representation of the ship. Also this was the first big Star Wars Lego set I bought, which in turn brought forth a wonderful second childhood of building the toys I dreamt of as a kid. I\\'ve since purchased six other models including the mighty Death Star. It really deserves the highest rating, but personal feelings aside, I can\\'t. Why? Because once constructed, the model is very flimsy. I\\'ve read other reviews that bragged about how sturdy it was, and I don\\'t see it. Every time I move it around, I have to be very careful. The side hedges snap out of place quite often and have to be reattached, and the ceiling panels can come off very easily. At one point, the entire cockpit assembly came apart and I had to dig out the instruction booklet to make sure it was properly attached. Honestly, I think this is a really awesome model, but it just doesn\\'t seem sturdy enough for the rough play kids will do with it once built. Okay, now that I said that I can get on to the good stuff. This is really a fun ship to build, and it will take a while. I spent four afternoons working on it, but that\\'s mostly because I like taking my time putting these things together. I suppose an expert builder with the time could put it together in one afternoon. Also, as with the Lego Death Star, which I also reviewed, the detail is amazing, and every single thing featured in the movies is here, from the holographic chess table to Luke\\'s Jedi training ball (even though it\\'s on the opposite side of the ship). The Luke figure even has a reversible face with the blast shield so he can put on the helmet and train. The tiny details like that are the things that always amaze me about these Lego sets. The inside of the ship is very spacious. You could literally fit a small army of mini-figs inside. I can\\'t help but think the Lego people could have done even more with the inside, but like I said, they already included everything you could think of. Also the mini-fig selection is awesome. You get all the main characters in their classic \"New Hope\" outfits. Though I find the inclusion of Darth Vader a bit odd since he never set foot on the Falcon. I would have liked to see Lando instead, since it was originally his ship and he later piloted it in Han\\'s absence. They could have even put him in his generals outfit from ROTJ, but it\\'s seems as if the Lego people wanted to stick to the characters from ANH. A couple minor complaints before I conclude. As other reviewers have noted, the cockpit is small. With all the room inside the main body of the ship, I think they could have done more here. Same with the gun turret seats in the center of the ship. It\\'s really just a flat panel with some controls attached and can\\'t be accessed from the interior of the ship. It seems more like an after thought. Overall, I hope no one lets my earlier criticism bother them too much. It really is an awesome ship, but I just find it a bit difficult to keep together, and I think that should be noted. In spite of a few flaws, it\\'s still very much worth it.',\n",
              " 'Chinese state media on Monday continued to play down the protocol-bending phone call last week between U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Taiwan\\'s president, with editorials in two newspapers saying the move showed Trump\\'s inexperience. China\\'s national English-language newspaper, the China Daily, said the 10-minute call \"exposed nothing but the inexperience Trump and his transition team have in dealing with foreign affairs\". \"The action was due to a lack of a proper understanding of the sensitive issues in Sino-U.S. relations and cross-Strait ties,\" it said. The Friday call was the first by a U.S. president-elect or president since President Jimmy Carter switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979, acknowledging Taiwan as part of \"one China\". China\\'s Foreign Ministry said on Saturday it had lodged \"stern representations\" with what it called the \"relevant U.S. side,\" urging the careful handling of the Taiwan issue to avoid any unnecessary disturbances in ties. China considers Taiwan a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday pointedly blamed Taiwan for the exchange, rather than Trump, calling it \"a petty action\". The China Daily said that for Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, the call \"achieves nothing substantial, only pride in making what is an illusionary \\'groundbreaking move\\', and temporarily diverting public attention on the island away from her bad performance\". \"It would be a mistake for Tsai and her party to over-interpret the significance of the call,\" it said. Her attempts to \"stir up tension... will ultimately backfire\". The Global Times, a hawkish tabloid under the ruling Communist Party\\'s top newspaper the People\\'s Daily, called Trump \"bluffing and unpredictable\", but said he did not have plans to overturn America\\'s international relationships. \"It seems that Trump is still taking advantage of his perceived fickleness and unpredictability to make some choppy waves in the Taiwan Straits to see if he can gain some bargaining chips before he is sworn in,\" it said. The Global Times added targeting him would be inappropriate since he is not yet president. \"He has zero diplomatic experience and is unaware of the repercussions of shaking up Sino-U.S. relations,\" it said. Instead, China could send a message to Trump by punishing Taiwan, wooing away one or two of the island\\'s diplomatic allies or beefing up military deployments against Taiwan, it said. \"It is certain that Trump doesn\\'t want a showdown with China, because it is not his ambition, and neither was it included in his promise to the electorate. He puts out feelers to sound China out and chalk up some petty benefits.\" On Monday, Taiwan\\'s Liberty Times, considered close to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, reported Tsai is planning to transit in New York early next month on her way to visit three diplomatic allies - Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador. The trip would take place before Trump\\'s inauguration January 20 and Tsai\\'s delegation would seek to meet with Trump\\'s team, including Reince Priebus, Trump\\'s White House chief of staff, the report said. Taiwan\\'s Presidential Office said media reports about a January trip were \"excessive speculation\". It said it would announce any presidential trips at the appropriate time.',\n",
              " 'Go to Article Donald Trump was willing to give up a very fulfilling life that took decades to build, so he could step up and take control of an out of control government. He and his family have already sacrificed so much because he chose to put his country first. Making sacrifices is certainly not something loudmouth liberals like Robert DeNiro are accustomed to. DeNiro was very vocal about his opposition to the wildly successful business man Donald J. Trump. He felt so strongly about his hate for Trump that made a video where he angrily stated he\\'d like to, \"punch him in the face.\" Now that Trump won the election in a landslide, DeNiro has chosen to get behind the Trump rioters who are terrorizing cities across America. Anti-Trump rioters are breaking windows, using baseball bats to smash the windshields of innocent citizens who get trapped in their hellish protests as they try to escape. Women who are taking part in the protests are being punched in the faces by men who are also taking part in the George Soros funded protests. American flags are being burned and families who are walking in major cities are being subjected to the most vile and disgusting, hateful language and images imaginable. If this is the kind of America that Robert DiNero is openly supporting? And if so, why would any American pay to see his movie,\"Comedian\"?  Robert De Niro gave anti-Donald Trump protesters across the United States his backing Friday as he spoke about how \"depressed\" the tycoon\\'s win in the presidential election had made him.  The 73-year-old star was on the red carpet at the world premiere of his new film \"The Comedian\" in Los Angeles when he was asked how he was coping with Trump\\'s victory over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.  \"How am I doing? I\\'m very depressed,\" the famously laconic \"Raging Bull\" actor told reporters.  \"We have to just wait and see how things go and keep our eyes ever vigilant on the new government.\"  Asked if he thought the protests were an appropriate response to the outcome of Tuesday\\'s election, he replied: \"Yes, absolutely. Things aren\\'t being done right.\"  Demonstrators took to the streets in Miami, Los Angeles, New York and other US cities for a third straight night on Friday.  In Manhattan, they held signs reading \"Your Wall Can\\'t Stand in Our Way\" â€” a reference to the anti-immigration barrier the billionaire has promised to build on the US border with Mexico.  De Niro hasn\\'t minced his words in his criticism of Trump, describing him as \"a punk,\" \"a pig\" and \"an idiot.\"  \"I\\'d like to punch him in the face,\" he said before the election.  Earlier in the day a town in southern Italy where De Niro\\'s grandparents came from offered the actor a means of escape.  \"If, after the disappointment of Trump, he wants to take refuge here, we are ready to welcome him,\" said Antonio Cerio, the mayor of Ferrazzano.  \"The Comedian,\" De Niro\\'s passion project which took him eight years to bring to the big screen, was part of this year\\'s program for the American Film Institute\\'s annual AFI Fest in Los Angeles. â€“ Yahoo  Here\\'s a clip of Trump-hater Megyn Kelly promoting DiNero\\'s hateful rant against Donald J.

              " 'The GOP convention is drawing all sorts, including nutbags like this one on YouTube. It s also drawing those who believe the GOP s policies are a major departure from what this country was supposed to be, despite all their claims that they want us to be exactly that. Because of that, the Freedom From Religion Foundation has a billboard up near their venue with a quote from none other than St. Reagan himself, and conservatives will absolutely despise it.This is the billboard below:FFRF quotes Reagan in Cleveland message to GOP convention https://t.co/MIkpBehtQv pic.twitter.com/6EGURARKW7 FFRF (@FFRF) June 27, 2016The point is clear: Keep church and state separate.Over the last couple of decades, Republicans have worked hard to entangle civil law with biblical law, and they hope to keep us from knowing the difference. Pea-brains like Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, James Inhofe, and more allow their religions to have a stranglehold on their policy decisions. The GOP itself has taken the Establishment Clause to mean that Christians should be free to do whatever they want to whomever they want, but all other religions need to put up with being restricted, and shut up altogether.The FFRF has been working to keep church and state separate since 1978, and this billboard is a brilliant idea because it takes a quote from one of the GOP s own idols and turns it back on them. Some places, like The Blaze, have already claimed that the quote is taken out of context, which is nonsense. The full quote is: Our very unity has been strengthened by our pluralism. We establish no religion in this country, we command no worship, we mandate no belief, nor will we ever. Church and state are, and must remain, separate. All are free to believe or not believe, all are free to practice a faith or not, and those who believe are free, and should be free, to speak of and act on their belief. That s in no way taken out of context. Instead, it s basically a summary of what Reagan was saying. Furthermore, Reagan s own son, Ron Reagan Jr., is on the Honorary Board of Distinguished Thinkers at the FFRF, and is an atheist who isn t afraid to burn in hell. There s little question he supports this display.It s actually the hateful, judgmental, narrow-minded Christians of the religious right who don t want to follow the Constitution, and they re dragging the GOP along with them, all in the name of following the Constitution. It s long past time for the GOP to stop pandering to the evangelicals and actually try to govern according to the Constitution, like they keep insisting they are.Featured image by Win McNamee/Getty Images',\n",
              " 'An Egyptian lawyer who is helping investigate the case of murdered Italian student Giulio Regeni was prevented from flying to a U.N. conference and detained by a special prosecutor, his supporters and a security source said. Ibrahim Metwaly, who founded the Association of the Families of the Disappeared after his son disappeared in suspicious circumstances four years ago, himself went missing while heading for his flight to Geneva on Sunday. Members of his group said he was taken from Cairo airport by airport security and he was not heard from until Wednesday when a state security prosecutor ordered him detained for 15 days on charges of joining a group founded illegally , judicial sources said. There was no comment from the Interior Ministry. A security source said Metwaly was legally arrested and not subjected to any violations. Rights activists say Egyptian security forces resort to kidnapping government opponents and keeping them in secret jails where they can spend weeks, months, or years without charge. The authorities deny the accusation. Italian graduate student Giulio Regeni, who was conducting research on Egyptian trade unions, disappeared in Cairo on Jan. 25 last year. His body was discovered in a ditch on the outskirts of the Egyptian capital on Feb. 3, showing signs of extensive torture. Metwaly has been assisting lawyers working on the Regeni case as an expert on enforced disappearances, according to one of the lawyers. I have no doubts Ibrahim s arrest was in connection to the Regeni case and his upcoming trip, a source at the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF), a Cairo-based NGO, told Reuters. ECRF lawyers are providing legal representation for the Regeni family in Egypt. Metwaly s son Abdelmoniem Metwaly said his father was now in a Cairo jail and that he was also charged with conducting espionage on behalf of a foreign entity , something he said referred to the U.N. Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances which he was due to address in Geneva. There was no immediate comment from the U.N. body. Regeni s murder has strained ties between Italy and Egypt, traditional Mediterranean allies with strong economic ties. Security and intelligence sources said Regeni was arrested the day he vanished and taken into custody. Egyptian officials have denied any involvement in his death. Italy recalled its ambassador in April 2016 as it sought to obtain evidence from Egypt to solve the murder. Magistrates in Rome and Cairo have met half a dozen times over the past year but no one has been charged. A new Italian ambassador arrived in Cairo on Wednesday. Pier Antonio Panzeri, an Italian lawmaker who chairs the European Parliament s Subcommittee on Human Rights, said in a statement: I am disturbed by alleged reports that lawyer Ibrahim Metwaly was arrested ... while he was about to fly to Geneva to address the U.N. Working Group.',\n",

              " 'President Vladimir Putin on Thursday accused American politicians of whipping up hysteria about a mythical Russian threat as a ploy to distract voters from their own failings in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election. Putin, addressing an audience of foreign policy experts gathered in southern Russia, repeatedly lashed out at the Obama administration, saying it did not keep its word on Syria, did not honour deals, and had falsely accused Moscow of all manner of sins. The U.S. government has formally accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organisations, while Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has accused Republican rival Donald Trump of being a Putin \"puppet\". Putin said he found it hard to believe that anyone seriously thought Moscow was capable of influencing the Nov. 8 election. \"Hysteria has been whipped up,\" said Putin. He said that was a ruse to cover up for the fact that the U.S. political elite had nothing to say about serious issues such as the country\\'s national debt or gun control. \"It\\'s much simpler to distract people with so-called Russian hackers, spies, and agents of influence. Does anyone really think that Russia could influence the American people\\'s choice in any way? Is America a banana republic or what? America is a great power.\" In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest dismissed Putin\\'s remarks as predictable and said the United States stood by its hacking allegations. \"There\\'s nothing that President Putin had to say today that I find particularly surprising or that in any way undermines the president\\'s confidence in the analysis that\\'s been released by the Department of Homeland Security and the intelligence community,\" said Earnest. Russian state TV and some of his past comments have suggested the Russian leader favours Trump, but Putin said he did not back any candidate in the U.S. election and was ready to work with any new U.S. president and to discuss any issue. Asked about Trump, whom he once described as \"very talented,\" Putin said the Republican candidate was deliberately adopting a showy style because he wanted to get his message across and that he represented ordinary voters fed up with the U.S. political elite. \"He has chosen a method to get through to voters\\' hearts,\" said Putin. \"He behaves extravagantly of course, we see this, but I think there\\'s a reason for this.\" Putin dismissed suggestions by some politicians in the West that Russia is poised to attack another country or intervene elsewhere in the Middle East apart from Syria. Such talk was designed to exaggerate the threat that Russia posed, he said, in order for certain countries to secure higher military spending and talk up their own importance. He said Russia was not planning to attack anyone. But he made clear Russia was in Syria for the long haul and intended to clear the city of Aleppo of what he called \"a nest of terrorists\", while trying to minimise civilian casualties.',\n",
              " '\"From the start,\" Hillary Clinton declared today in Reno, \"Donald Trump has built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia. He has taken hate groups mainstream, and [is] helping a radical fringe take over the Republican Party.\" The speech that followed those words was an extended argument that her opponent is a racist, a conspiracy theorist, and a man temperamentally unfit to be president. Clinton\\'s campaign had promoted this in advance as an address about \"Donald Trump and his advisors\\' embrace of the disturbing \\'alt-right\\' political philosophy\"â€”the alt-right being an umbrella term for an assortment of racist micro-movements and online subcultures. Yesterday I suggested that making the alt-right the stars of such a speech could only give a signal boost to what is, after all, a rather obscure political faction. But Clinton\\'s comments about that faction took up only about a minute of her remarks. And while that minute was pretty juicy, the alt-right wasn\\'t really the rally\\'s star villain after all. The star villain was Donald Trump. Everyone else that Clinton brought into the addressâ€”the alt-right, Breitbart, Alex Jones, David Duke, Nigel Farage, Vladimir Putinâ€”was there in a supporting role. Some of Clinton\\'s arguments didn\\'t make a lot of sense. She led her litany, oddly, by quoting Trump\\'s recent remarks about how bad blacks have it in America. (\"Poverty. Rejection. Horrible education. No housing. No homes. No ownership. Crime at levels nobody has seen.\") Most people would call his comments a clumsy attempt to reassure voters that he cares about the black community\\'s problems, but Clinton declared them \"a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters.\" She also wildly overstated the alt-right\\'s influence, declaring that \"the de facto merger between Breitbart and the Trump campaign\" means the alt-rightists have \"effectively taken over the Republican Party.\" She was on sturdier ground at other moments, as when she mentioned Trump\\'s habit of retweeting white nationalists or his false claim that he watched thousands of New Jersey Muslims cheer the 9/11 attacks. Running through all her claims, both the weak ones and the strong ones, was one basic theme: Donald Trump is a bigot and a nut. And while that\\'s an idea you\\'ve been hearing ever since the mogul turned reality TV star entered the race, this was as forceful and concentrated an expression of it as I\\'ve ever heard emerge from Hillary Clinton\\'s mouth. It\\'s bound to fire up her supporters, and I expect it will help her get out the vote. Whether it also leads a bunch of curious conservatives to Google \"alt-right\" depends, I suppose, on how much coverage that minute of the speech gets in the next few days. But the guy who must be really delighted right now is Alex Jones. Hillary Clinton just attacked him by name! His listeners will be hearing clips from this speech til Ragnarok.',\n",
              " 'Donald Trump appeared on Fox News on Monday night, only to be embarrassingly stumped by Bill O Reilly.O Reilly wanted to know if Trump plans on taking military action against Iran if he becomes president, and Trump totally demonstrated his lack of foreign policy knowledge by dodging the question and ranting about things he really doesn t understand. If you re elected president are you going to take military action against Iran? O Reilly asked. Are you going to do something to that country? Well, I would want to help Saudi Arabia, Trump replied with what seems to be a reference to Iranians attacking the Saudi Arabian embassy in retaliation against a mass execution the Saudis recently committed on New Year s Day in which 47 were killed, including a Shiite cleric. I would want to protect Saudi Arabia, Trump claimed. But Saudi Arabia is going to have to help us economically Trump suggested that he might attack Iran if Saudi Arabia offered the right price but remained largely unwilling to say one way or another whether he would get America involved in yet another costly and bloody war in the Middle East.O Reilly continued to press Trump for an answer, calling him out for dodging the question.Trump then went on a tirade against the Iran nuclear deal, calling it a disastrous deal that Iran has already supposedly broken before claiming that Iran will have a nuclear weapon very soon. Clearly, Trump is not aware of the fact that Iran recently surrendered their entire stockpile of enriched uranium to the Russians, which is definitive proof that the Iran nuclear deal is a success because it is doing exactly what it was designed to do.The Iran nuclear deal stands as one of President Obama s greatest achievements, and should not be abandoned in favor of war when diplomacy is working. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia is nothing more than ISIS posing as a legitimate nation. They use Sharia law and behead so many people every year that ISIS leaders must be envious. The only reason our government has failed to call the Saudis out for their horrible human rights record is because they control the second largest oil reserves in the world.This is why it is not only important for the United States to reject military action in the Middle East, we need to become energy independent so that we no longer have to rely on Saudi Arabia for our energy needs. Frankly, the United States government should grow a pair and strongly condemn Saudi Arabia right now for behaving like a terrorist organization.The bottom line, however, is that Donald Trump is unfit to be commander-in-chief. He not only wants to send American troops to die needlessly in Iran, he wants to make Saudi Arabia pay for it. Basically, Trump would turn America into a puppet for the Saudis. But more likely, he would damage relations with both nations and put America squarely in the middle of a potential conflict that could easily turn into World War III.America does not need more war. We need peace. And as O Reilly pointed out, voters have the right to know what Trump plans to do, even if Trump thinks they have no right to know at all.Here s the video via YouTube.',\n",
              " 'Politicians have been known to do a lot of things to get elected. They usually cater and pander to a group of people who they think will have the best chance at casting a vote in their favor. In the case of Republican presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz, those he s decided to cater to are the residents of Idiot America.Cruz has decided to go all in trying to get the ultra-religious, absent from reality, guns and God group of folks who love to hunt, hate gay people and live far away from populated areas. People otherwise known as extreme, right-wing Republicans.Perfectly pandering to this demographic, Cruz paired himself up with Duck Dynasty and their bigot-in-chief Phil Robertson. Robertson is about as anti-gay and bigoted as one could ever hope to be, so of course he s now endorsed one of the leading bigot candidates running for president Ted Cruz.In a new campaign commercial for Cruz, Robertson, with his face painting black camo for hunting, tells everyone the qualifications he wants to see in a president: Is he or she godly? Does he or she love us? Can he or she do the job? And finally, would they kill a duck and put em in a pot and make up a good duck gumbo? I ve looked at the candidates. Ted Cruz is my man. (Let s just pause for a second and acknowledge that Robertson said he or she. Got to at least give credit where credit is due)Now, as far as Cruz being the man for the job of President of the United States? Yeah, not so much. He s a smarmy man who will say or do anything to get his way. This includes, but is not limited to, likely not even being as religious as he says he is, or as constitutional as he claims to be.Cruz tends to do things for show, and no greater example of this can be seen than in this very commercial where he puts on blackface, pardon me, hunting camo paint that looks remarkably like blackface and someone should have told him that, and sits down to hold his gun and hunt with Robertson.Cruz is all like, Look at me! I m just like you! I like to hunt and play make-believe Rambo, too! Ignore the fact that I m insanely wealthy and married to Goldman Sachs! Vote for me! He knows exactly what he is doing. He s a smart guy, gotta give him that much, which also makes him irrefutably dangerous. He knows how to play the game, get what he wants, and he doesn t seem to care who might get hurt along the way.However, this ad right here, as funny as it may be, because it s pretty goddamn funny, also show to the depths he ll go to cater to a specific voter population.

              " 'Federal appeals courts in the states of Washington and Virginia are set to hear arguments this week on the legality of President Donald Trump\\'s most recent travel ban, which sharply limits visitors and immigrants from eight countries, six of them Muslim-majority. Challengers, including the state of Hawaii and immigrant advocacy organizations and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), argue the ban is discriminatory and violates the U.S. Constitution. The Trump administration says it is necessary to protect the United States from terrorist attacks. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is based in San Francisco, will hold a hearing in Seattle, Washington on Dec. 6 and the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has its hearing on Dec. 8. Soon after taking office in January, Trump signed an order temporarily barring all refugees and visitors from seven predominately Muslim countries. The decision led to chaos at airports and numerous legal challenges and the administration eventually replaced it with a second, somewhat narrower order. When the second ban expired in September, Trump replaced it with a presidential proclamation indefinitely restricting travel from Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad, North Korea and barring certain government officials from Venezuela. The administration said the restrictions were put in place after a worldwide review of each country\\'s ability to issue reliable passports and share data with the United States. After the most recent order was issued, the same challengers who sued to stop the earlier bans went back to court. They said the new version still discriminated against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution. The lawsuits did not dispute the restrictions placed on Venezuela and North Korea. All refugees were temporarily barred as part of Trump\\'s first order but were not addressed in the latest ban. Instead, under a separate directive issued Oct. 24, refugees from 11 countries mostly in the Middle East and Africa now face additional security screening. The 9th circuit appeals court on Nov. 13 ruled the ban could go partially into effect for everyone without close family relationships to people in the United States. The White House has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to lift those partial restrictions while the cases are moving forward in lower courts so that the ban would apply to everyone. The government argues the president has broad authority to decide who can come into the United States, but detractors say the expanded ban violates a law forbidding the government from discriminating based on nationality when issuing immigrant visas. The administration has repeatedly said the ban is not discriminatory and pointed out that many Muslim-majority countries are unaffected by it. Trump has made statements, however, that his legal opponents say reinforce their contention that his actions are based in anti-Muslim sentiments. Last week, for example, the president shared on Twitter anti-Muslim videos posted by a far-right British party leader. In response to the tweet, Neal Katyal, attorney for the State of Hawaii Tweeted: \"Thanks! See you in court next week.\" The ACLU said in a letter sent to the Supreme Court on Monday that the group planned to file a motion that would expand the record to include the recent statements by the President.',\n",
              " 'The first cruise ship in nearly 40 years to sail across the Florida Straits from Miami to Havana docked in the Cuban capital on Monday, cutting a ribbon of water that for years was a symbol of the political gulf between the two countries. Hundreds of Cubans stood near the dock and on Havana\\'s sea wall, snapping pictures with smartphones and filming the arrival of the ship, Adonia, which arrived in the port after crossing overnight from Miami. The ship is operated by Fathom Travel, a unit of Carnival Corporation. Isabel Buznego, a passenger aboard the cruise, was born in Cuba but left about 40 years ago, when she was 5. She said she was overcome with emotion when she first spotted the fortifications that protect Havana\\'s bay. \"That really got to me,\" Ms. Buznego said. The ship\\'s arrival on Monday caused a stir among the locals, too: So thick was the crowd as the American passengers disembarked that a passing tourist asked, \"Who\\'s the celebrity?\" The cruise was the latest stage in the surge of American travel to the island since President Obama announced the normalization of relations between the United States and Cuba in December 2014. The arrival of a ship from Florida recalls the heady days before Fidel Castro\\'s 1959 revolution, when the island was a tropical getaway for Americans, and Cubans could board a ship in Havana and be in Miami within hours. Commercial sea traffic all but dried up when the United States broke off diplomatic and commercial relations with Cuba in the early 1960s. The Florida Straits became a treacherous barrier that tens of thousands of desperate Cubans crossed, or drowned trying to cross, on rafts and leaky vessels. Plans for the cruise ran into trouble in April after it emerged that it would exclude passengers because they were barred by the Cuban government from entering the country by sea. That prompted a furor in Miami and Washington, and the Cuban government lifted the restriction. Robert L. Muse, a lawyer in Washington who specializes in laws related to Cuba, said the Cuban government\\'s concession was probably driven by diplomatic considerations, not because it was concerned about lost tourism dollars. \"If it were purely about the money, they wouldn\\'t have backed down,\" Mr. Muse said. With Washington eager for the dÃ©tente to produce more commercial deals, the Cubans conceded \"to keep the dialogue afloat,\" he said. The last time an American cruise ship sailed to Cuba from the United States was in the late 1970s, during a brief thaw begun by President Jimmy Carter. Since the 2014 announcement of restored relations, several ferry and cruise companies have applied to the Treasury Department for licenses to carry American passengers to Cuba. So far, only Carnival and a French company, Ponant, have reported receiving a license to offer cruises to Cuba from American ports. The Treasury Department has issued a general license to American ferry operators, but they have yet to get permission from the Cuban authorities. For Cubans, the possibility of regular sea crossings to the United States brings the prospect of closer ties with their expatriate friends and relatives living there. Antonio Serrano, 53, a hospital worker who was watching the Adonia passengers arrive in Old Havana on Monday, said he was there to show returning Cubans that his \"solidarity is strong. \"',\n",

(If the \"US Politics\" box does not show up, click the \"See more\" button under the grid of boxes.) Facebook makes a deduction about your political views based on the pages that you like â€” or on your political preference, if you stated one, on your profile page. If you like the page for Hillary Clinton, Facebook might categorize you as a liberal. Even if you do not like any candidates\\' pages, if most of the people who like the same pages that you do â€” such as Ben and Jerry\\'s ice cream â€” identify as liberal, then Facebook might classify you as one, too. Facebook has long been collecting information on its users, but it recently revamped the ad preferences page, making it easier to view. The information is valuable. Advertisers, including many political campaigns, pay Facebook to show their ads to specific demographic groups. The labels Facebook assigns to its users help campaigns more precisely target a particular audience. For instance, Donald J. Trump\\'s presidential campaign has paid for its ads to be shown to those who Facebook has labeled politically moderate. Campaigns can also use the groupings to show different messages to different supporters. They may want to show an ad to their supporters, for example, that is unlike an ad targeted at people just tuning in to the election. It is not clear how aggressively Facebook is gathering political information on users outside the United States. The social network has 1. 7 billion active users, including about 204 million in the United States. Political outlook is just one of the attributes Facebook compiles on its users. Many of the others are directly commercial: whether you like television comedy shows, video games or Nascar. To learn more about how political campaigns are targeting voters on social media, The New York Times is collecting Facebook ads from our readers with a project called AdTrack.

              " 'Fortune released their The World s 19 Most Disappointing Leaders list on March 30. Coming in at number one on the list is Michigan s Republican governor Rick Snyder.Fortune gave Snyder the Don t Blame Me, I m Just The Governor Award for his failures over his handling of the Flint water crisis. Fortune writes:Snyder and his team sparked national outrage after an attempt at cost-savings left the impoverished city of Flint, Mich. with a lead-tainted water supply that is being blamed for illness and brain damage, especially among its youngest residents. Called to testify before Congress, Snyder, who touted his competence in his gubernatorial campaign, labeled the experience the most humbling of his life then attempted to shift blame. He described it as a failure of government and blasted the Environmental Protection Agency for its dumb and dangerous rules on allowable amounts of lead in water systems.Because you don t win an award like that and not offer a response, Ari Adler, a spokesman for Snyder, said that Snyder is concerned with fixing problems, not internet polls. The rank of each leader received was based on internet votes. Though, the 19 leaders in the poll were chosen by Fortune s editorial staff.Adler also said: The decision on whether to use corrosion control in the Flint water supply was not about saving money, but rather was a mistake made by bureaucrats who misinterpreted a flawed federal rule. Gov. Snyder is the only leader at all levels of government involved in the Flint water crisis who has been willing to stand up and apologize, take responsibility for what happened on his watch, and tackle the problems head on to fix what happened in Flint and fix the system that caused it to happen. It s responses like this that make one wonder how much money Snyder has wasted after he hired two PR firms while the nation raged against him. You can t say that you have accepted responsibility for a crisis right after you blame other people for that crisis.There is also the fact that the Flint water crisis did not happen in a bubble. It happened while the Snyder administration worked fervently to erode democracy in Michigan. It happened while Detroit s and other communities school systems and critical infrastructure were left to ruin.That s why Snyder s sorry-not-sorry is even more disingenuous than it might seem at first glance. He has at no point even acknowledged that his administration s system-wide dismantlement of local governments and austerity measurements that have proven to be fatal, have anything to do with the crisis. The only thing Snyder kind-of-but-not-really acknowledges is that his administration is in charge and, therefore, shares some of the responsibility for the Flint water crisis on the basis of Snyder being Michigan s figurehead.So here s to Snyder s latest achievement. Let it be the first of many.Featured Image: (Photo by Brett Carlsen/Getty Images)',\n",

Be Sociable, Share!  In the aftermath of one of the most memorable October shocks in presidential campaign history, and down the final stretch in the presidential race which has just over one week left, Wikileaks continues its ongoing broadside attack against the Clinton campaign with the relentless Podesta dump, by unveiling another 2,620 emails in the latest, Part 24 of its Podesta release, bringing the total emails released so far to exactly 39,511.  The release comes hours after Wikileaks warned that it was launching its \"Phase 3\" of election coverage this week..  In the latest, Sunday set, of emails Doug Band commented on Teneo\\'s relationship with the Clinton Foundation, saying \"if this story gets out, we are screwed,\" we learned that Google\\'s Eric Schmidt wanted to be \"head outside advisor\" to the Clinton campaign, and a potential conflict of interest with the Clinton Foundation assisting El Salvador in obtaining $50 million in cash. As usual we are parsing through the latest release and will bring readers the more notable emails. Among today\\'s emails, we find a May 2015 email from Jen Palmieri to Joel Benenson of the Benenson strategy group suggests that Hillary Clinton knows everything about the Clinton Foundation donors. We also find more direct involvement by Google\\'s Eric Schmidt, when in an April 2015 email to Cheryl Mills he tells her \"I have put together my thoughts on the campaign ideas and I have scheduled some meetings in the next few weeks for veterans of the campaign to tell me how to make these ideas better.\" A January 2012 email from Laura Graham to Cheryl Mills sheds some more light on the Teneo scandal: \"Below see my draft. I really took a shot in the dark here and didn\\'t know how far we should go on these issues. I remain concerned that email will be forwarded to press and so am against sending an email altogether. If we want to include the broader list of individuals going to the PO (I left a marker in the text for that) then we obviously have to meet with people before any email or staff meeting.\" A May 2013 email from Neera Tanden address to John Podesta discussing a WaPo article how a Super PAC plans to coordinated directly with the Clinton campaign leads to the following exchange: That\\'s fine But skirting if not violating law doesn\\'t help her INMHO This article originally appeared on ZeroHedge.com .

              " 'People like to pretend that Mike Pence is the grown-up in the room compared to Donald Trump s brash childishness from the White House. However, he proved that wrong on Sunday, when he left the Indiana Colts football game because a few of the players on the team opposing the Colts chose to take a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality against black and brown Americans. Taking a leaf out of Trump s playbook, Pence tweeted:I left today\\'s Colts game because @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem. Vice President Pence (@VP) October 8, 2017While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I don\\'t think it\\'s too much to ask NFL players to respect the Flag and our National Anthem Vice President Pence (@VP) October 8, 2017Just like Trump, Pence forgets the meaning of the First Amendment, and seems to think that his position gives him the right to try to bully owners, players, and ultimately the National Football League into following his orders. Further, it is worth noting that the Colts were playing the San Francisco 49ers, which is the former team of Colin Kaepernick, the man who started this protest before being blacklisted from the NFL for taking a stand against police brutality against people of color. Further, Pence and Trump admitted that they used the situation to divide the country and make some kind of point on the taxpayers dime because of course we paid for Pence to travel to that football game. For one thing, the press was kept in the van, in anticipation of Pence stirring the pot and then leaving:The media pool was kept in the vans ahead of the game instead of being led in with VPOTUS. https://t.co/NXIFZCp3fb Vaughn Hillyard (@VaughnHillyard) October 8, 2017FLAG: Was Pence leaving Colts game a political stunt? Reporters were told to stay in van bc \"there may be an early departure from the game.\" Peter Alexander (@PeterAlexander) October 8, 2017Then, Trump admitted to ordering Pence to leave if the 49ers took a knee, which of course everyone knew they would:I asked @VP Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled, disrespecting our country. I am proud of him and @SecondLady Karen. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2017So, in short, this was all premeditated racial pot stirring. Unsurprising from Trump, but somewhat surprising from Pence, who has been trying very hard to keep up the idea of how OMFG #notracist! he is. Well, that s out the window now.Another white supremacist takes his hood off in the Trump Administration.',\n",
              " 'The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\\'s watchdog is expanding a review of administrator Scott Pruitt\\'s frequent travels to his home state Oklahoma to include more recent trips taken on military and charter flights, according to a memo seen on Friday. The Office of Inspector General had been investigating the \"frequency, cost and extent\" of Pruitt\\'s travels to Oklahoma through July 31, and will now expand the \"active audit\" to include all travel, including the use of private and military flights he has taken up to Sept. 30. The expanded review coincides with heightened scrutiny surrounding the travels of President Donald Trump\\'s cabinet officials with reports that some have spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for non-commercial flights. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price resigned last week over his use of costly private charter planes for government business. The Interior Department\\'s own inspector general last week confirmed it also opened an investigation into travels by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke after receiving numerous complaints about his use of three chartered flights, including one on an aircraft owned by an oil and gas executive. Energy Secretary Rick Perry also used a private charter flight last week, Reuters reported. The flight cost $11,000, according to travel records provided to Reuters by the Department of Energy. The records show that Perry took four non-commercial flights between May and last week totaling nearly $56,000 of taxpayer money. Department spokeswoman Shaylyn Hayes said in a statement on Friday that in the \"rare instances where government-owned or chartered aircraft have been used, trips were pre-approved by an Ethics officer within the Office of General Counsel.\" Separately, a spokeswoman for the Energy Department\\'s inspector general office could not confirm nor deny whether it is investigating his travels. In addition to investigating the frequency of Pruitt\\'s travels, the watchdog is also evaluating whether Pruitt followed EPA travel protocols and whether \"EPA\\'s policies and procedures are sufficiently designed to prevent fraud, waste and abuse with the Administrator\\'s travel.\" Pruitt has taken at least four flights that were either not commercial or military-chartered since mid-February, according to government records. EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman said the four non-commercial flights had been cleared by EPA lawyers. Pruitt had also traveled to Oklahoma on at least 43 of the 92 days of March, April and May, according to copies of his travel records obtained by the Environmental Integrity Project watchdog and reviewed by Reuters last month, which prompted the initial investigation.',\n",

This TV has an LED screen and in my opinion this the way to go (LED is similar to LCD its back-lit better so that they are no dark spots on the screen). Now add in that this TV can directly connect to the internet and I'm sold. TV's of this class have never been cheaper. One thing that I have found with TV's that its very important to actually look at the TV in person. Now when you look at the TV's, go to a place like Walmart to see them, because many times specialty stores like Best Buy play with the lighting controls on the TV and in the store to skew the image to there advantage. Once you look at the TV simply look and decide which one looks better to you. Additionally I found this mount to be very helpful http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00K69M0TY The next step to take into consideration is features. Here are a few that come with this TV: This Samsung comes with Auto Volume which automatically adjusts the volume of the desired channel, lowering the sound output when the modulation signal is high or raising the sound output when the modulation signal is low. This reduces the difference in volume when changing channels. The Auto Volume feature can be set to Normal, Night or Off. With this Smart HDTV there is a full web browser with WiFi built-in apps made for TV. Some of the apps this TV features is Hulu Plus, YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, and Twitter. Browse the web while you watch movies and TV shows, and enjoy TV while you chat with friends and family online, all on one screen with this Samsung. As far as outputs most of these TV's will come with more than enough Inputs and Outputs. This TV comes with 4 HDMI Audio/Video In, 1 Ethernet LAN In/Out, 1 RCA Component Audio/Video In amd 1 Digital Coaxial Audio Out. Next thing when shopping for a TV is in box technology. Here are some of the features of thisTV: Thank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have.\",\n",

              " 'During a recent appearance on Good Morning Britain, Donald Trump made several claims about Muslims that are, perhaps unsurprisingly to most people, completely bogus. During the interview, Trump claimed that one of the biggest challenges in the fight against terrorism is that good Muslims are withholding information about terrorist plots. It s like they re protecting each other, Trump said during the interview. They have to report the bad ones. And if you report the bad ones, then all of a sudden you re not going to have the problems. Here s the interview:This statement does not hold up to empirical evidence. Muslims do in fact quit often turn in radical extremists. Vox reports: In 2014, University of North Carolina sociologist Charles Kurzman identified 188 cases since 9/11 where the police had publicly identified a Muslim American as a suspected terrorist and disclosed where the initial tip came from. Of those 188, 54 individuals were brought to the government s attention via tips from members of the Muslim-American community. Muslim Americans were the single largest source of tips identified in Kurzman s study. To further illustrate the stupidity of Trump s claims, let s look at some other facts. Trump is implying that it is the Muslim population s responsibility to report problems to the authorities. By doing so he is placing responsibility for the actions of terrorists on Muslim communities shoulders.There are approximately 1.6 billion Muslims in the world. That s about 23% of the world s entire population. Only about 3.3 million Muslims lives in the United States. During this interview, and for the entirety of his campaign, Trump has been using nearly a quarter of the world s population as a political scapegoat. The reality is that the Islamic State and other terror groups are followers of Salafi Jihadism. They are a relatively tiny cult of extremists, that mainly live in concentrated geographic regions.The chance that a Muslim person would actually know a Jihadist is pretty slim. The odds that they might stumble upon information about a possible terror plot is even slimmer. When we take that into account, and we look at the number of tips that come from Muslims about possible terror attacks since 9/11 it becomes quite clear that Muslims do almost always turn in information regarding possible terrorist activities when they come across it and they know what they have come across.It s almost as if Muslims almost always do the reasonable thing that anyone would do if they were in that situation.Of course, none of this will probably matter to Trump or his followers. If he says he saw a video of Muslims cheering in New Jersey after 9/11, that s what they saw too. Featured image from video screenshot',\n",
              " 'Ben, there are two very different things going on here. One is technical and related to the actual science and the actual statistics, the second is political, and is much more concerned with how incidents like this can be portrayed. The second is the issue here. The unfortunate fact is that the \\'secret science\\' meme is an extremely powerful rallying call to people who have no idea about what is going on. Claiming (rightly or wrongly) that information is being hidden has a huge amount of resonance (as you know), much more so than whether Douglass et al know their statistical elbow from a hole in the ground. Thus any increase in publicity on this - whether in the pages of Nature or elsewhere - is much more likely to bring further negative fallout despite your desire to clear the air. Whatever you say, it will still be presented as you hiding data. The contrarians have found that there is actually no limit to what you can ask people for (raw data, intermediate steps, additional calculations, residuals, sensitivity calculations, all the code, a workable version of the code on any platform etc.), and like Somali pirates they have found that once someone has paid up, they can always shake them down again. Thus, I would not advise any public statements on this. Instead, email you immediate superiors and the director with a short statement along the lines of what you suggest below (i.e. of course you want open science, the data *are* in the public domain (with links) and calls for more intermediate steps are just harassment to prevent scientists doing what they are actually paid too). I wouldn\\'t put in anything specifically related to McIntyre. A much more satisfying response would be to demonstrate how easy it is to replicate the analysis in the paper starting from scratch using openly available data (such as through Joe Sirott\\'s portal) and the simplest published MSU weighting function. If you can show that this can be done in a couple of hours (or whatever), it makes the other side look like incompetent amateurs. Maybe someone has a graduate student available....?

But stock and options traders, often moved to action by political headlines, are responding with a big \\'meh.\\' Options bets on volatility around the Nov. 8 election are running lower than could be expected given how stocks have performed in past election cycles, BNP Paribas said. Typically, stock market volatility picks up around presidential elections. Traders use options to guard against outsized market reaction to such events. The CBOE Volatility Index, the most widely followed gauge of near-term investor anxiety, had some big spikes this year, hitting a four-month high after the Brexit vote. But there is little to suggest that November is a big worry for stocks. Investors are focused on the quarterly earnings season starting next week. They might also be taking the view that both the Republican and Democratic prospective nominees would be more favorable for business than the current administration, analysts said. \"It\\'s like the opposite of \\'Alien vs. Predator,\\'\" said Mark Sebastian, chief investment officer at volatility arbitrage hedge fund Karman Line Capital in Chicago, referring to the 2004 American science fiction film which had the tagline \\'whoever wins, we lose.\\' \"Here, no matter who wins, Wall Street does better,\" he said. Despite being called anti-business by some on Wall Street, the Obama administration has been in power over one of the best presidential cycles for stocks on record. Per BNP Paribas data, S&P 500 Index options forward implied volatility, which measures volatility expectations embedded in options, shows no dislocation over the remaining election campaign period. Had there been a big bump-up in this measure for November it would have been a sign that traders were loading up on protective contracts. \"The market is not ascribing a large probability to a high volatility scenario over the election period,\" said Stewart Warther, an equity derivatives strategist at BNP Paribas. Market-makers, or dealers which quote prices for options, are also not expressing a great deal of anxiety over stock gyrations. If stock volatility does not pick up in November, that would be a departure from the norm, according a BNP Paribas analysis of data going back to 1948. \"The shape of the (volatility) curve definitely is upward sloping but it\\'s not like there is a huge hump out in November,\" said Steve Sosnick, an equity risk manager at Timber Hill, the market-making unit of Interactive Brokers Group Inc. \"We have seen some demand for options but I would say it\\'s hardly a frenzy.\"',\n",
              " \"What a wreak - literally. We have a shipwreck, a love affair on the rocks, people trying to run other's lives when they can't run their own. Ross in deep in debt with Warleggan liking nothing more than to crush him. Julia is born and the apple of her parents eye. Verity Poldark & Andrew Blamey want forever and Francis say no. Mark & Karen Daniels and Dr. Enys - oh my! Affairs, Bitterness, christening, deceit, envy, folly, gambling, hunger, illness, jealousy, kindness, lies, murder, oppression, parties, quarrels, revelry, snobs, violence. And in the end a beautiful moment of hope. Totally addicted to this series back in the 70's watching it on Masterpiece Theatre Sunday nights with my mom and sisters. I eagerly gobbled up the first 4 books 1945 - Ross Poldark 1946 - Demelza 1950 - Jeremy Poldark 1953 - Warleggan I stopped reading the series in 1977 as the novels had gotten so dark that I wasn't enjoying where the author was taking the characters. 1973 - The Black Moon 1976 - The Four Swans 1977 - The Angry Tide I was poking in a book store on vacation and picked up 'The Twisted Sword' and enjoyed it tremendously (with one exception - I didn't care for the outcome for Jeremy at all). It was so good seeing Zacky Martin & Mrs. Zacky, Tholly Tregolis, Jud & Trudy Paynter - they hadn't changed at all. Dwight & Caroline Enys (and Horace), Verity & Andrew Blamey. And of course Demelza and Ross (still all too human). George Warleggan remains the same fascinating character. And Cornwall, Nampara (the Ross Poldark home) Wheal Grace and Wheal Leisure all so familiar 40 years later. 1981 - The Stranger from the Sea 1982 - The Miller's Dance 1984 - The Loving Cup 1990 - The Twisted Sword 2002 - Bella Poldark I am not sure I will pick up the last book as from the the reviews I don't think I will enjoy it as much. The author passed away in 2003 at age 90 soit is truly the last written by him. From the publisher: Demelza, the miner's daughter that Poldark rescued from a fairground rabble, is now his wife. Demelza's efforts to adapt to the ways of the gentry bring her confusion and heartache, despite the joy in the birth of their first child. Additionally the seeds of dispute with Warleggan are sown. Also from the Publisher: the Poldark series, the subject of the landmark BBC series Ross Poldark is a heartwarming, gripping, and utterly entertaining saga that brings to life an unforgettable cast of characters and one of the greatest love stories of our age. An intricately plotted story spanning loves, lives, and generations. The Poldark series is the masterwork of Winston Graham, who evoked the period and people like only he could, and created a world of rich and poor, loss and love, that readers will not soon forget.\",\n",
              " 'It s no secret that German Chancellor Angela Merkel is no fan of Donald Trump. They had a frosty visit when she visited the United States. He infamously refused to shake her hand for the cameras as is customary in the Oval Office, and even reportedly presented her with some kind of bogus bill for supposed expenses with regards to financial obligations to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).Combine that with the fact that Trump publicly scolded our fellow NATO member nations at the summit in Brussels, and you have a recipe for Chancellor Merkel coming to a very grave conclusion: The United States of America can no longer be trusted to defend its NATO allies and support Article V which states that when one nation is attacked, all nations are attacked as long as Donald Trump is president. This is an especially striking blow, since the only time Article V of NATO has been invoked is when the U.S. was attacked on September 11, 2001.With all of this in mind, Merkel has made a stunning and historic statement to her fellow member nations of the European Union: Thanks to Trump, America is not to be relied on any longer. Merkel said of Trump s America: The times in which we could completely depend on others are on the way out. I ve experienced that in the last few days. We Europeans truly have to take our fate into our own hands. Merkel had the same advice regarding Great Britain, though with less harsh words. She still insists that respectful relationships with Britain and America will be maintained, but told the remaining European Union nations, we have to fight for our own destiny. Another warning came as a result of Trump s refusal to commit to the Paris Climate Agreement at the G7 Summit. All of the other six member nations of the agreement reaffirmed their commitment to addressing the problem of climate change, but Trump and thus the United States did not. Merkel said that this is a very difficult, not to say very unsatisfactory development and a six against one dialogue with regards to a grave world matter. A matter that, by the way, Trump has previously called a hoax. Here is the tweet that confirms his crazy views there:The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012In short, with Donald Trump as president, the United States of America is no longer the leader of the free world. Germany is. Hopefully, Merkel gets re-elected, and can diminish Trump s power on the world stage until he is either impeached and removed from office, resigns, or his term ends.The fate of the free world depends on it.',\n",
              " 'Conservatives would be so pissed if this actually happened.In what would perhaps be the most entertaining Supreme Court nominating process in American history, a petition is circulating asking President Obama to nominate Anita Hill to replace recently deceased Justice Antonin Scalia on the bench.Hill is most remembered for her courageous testimony against current Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas during his confirmation hearings in 1991. Hill testified that Thomas made unwanted sexual advances toward her during his stint as supervisor at the Department of Education. Despite her passing a lie detector test while he refused to take one, the Senate still confirmed Thomas 52-48 in the narrowest margin since the 1800s after other women were denied the chance to testify in support of Hill.Thomas and his conservative supporters, of course, demonized Hill, accusing her of being used by white liberals to cut down an uppity black with a high-tech lynching. But while Hill may seem to be a controversial choice to fill Scalia s seat on the high court, it s not out of the realm of possibility, nor does she lack the qualifications.Hill is an experienced attorney who also serves as University Professor of Social Policy, Law, and Women s Studies at Brandeis University. The 59-year-old attended Oklahoma State University and Yale Law School. She is one of the most prominent experts in her field and certainly possesses the legal and academic chops to serve on the Supreme Court.Furthermore, there has never been an African-American woman on the Court, which makes this an opportunity to make history with a much needed change. What better way to replace a racist misogynist like Scalia than with an educated black woman who specializes in social policy?Not only that, just imagine how uncomfortable her nomination would make Clarence Thomas feel. He d probably be sweating bullets while watching and hoping the nomination process eliminates her as the nominee. And it would be incredibly hard for conservatives to grill her without reminding the American public of how big of creep Thomas is. And if Republicans are too hard on her, they can be the ones accused of a high-tech lynching of an uppity black woman as they let their sexism and racism fly during hearings that would would likely be nationally televised and strewn across social media.And even if Hill fails to be confirmed, it would make Republicans look like the terrible lawmakers and human beings that they are, all while embarrassing the hell out of Thomas, who may even end up feeling too exposed to remain on the Court. And if she does get confirmed, he might resign anyway or at the very least be forced to watch as the woman he harassed and humiliated over 20 years ago puts on the same black robe to help the American people in a way he has refused to do throughout his own tenure. She could end up being the social justice crusader women and minorities have hoped for and become more revered than Scalia and Thomas could ever hope to be.As the petition says, Now THAT S Justice!

              " 'Now that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has crossed the Rubicon of racism, the people are starting to lash out, and rightfully so.After disqualifying the Trump University judge because of his race, Republicans and Democrats alike have been holding Trump s feet to the fire some more so than others. Most Republicans have simply disavowed his comments while some have flat out called him a fraud (and of course Democrats have been saying these things since June of last year).But the most glaring critique from any official came from Democratic Representative Filemon Vela of Texas, who penned a scathing open letter to Trump. Starting out by agreeing that Mexico should do more to deter cartel violence, Vela quickly amps up his attack, saying, Your ignorant anti-immigrant opinions, your border wall rhetoric, and your recent bigoted attack on an American jurist are just plain despicable. Pretty standard criticism. But it gets so much better. Vela beats Trump at his own purity game, and notes that his ancestry is more American than Trump s, and that his family weren t chicken hawks: Before you dismiss me as just another Mexican, let me point out that my great-great grandfather came to this country in 1857, well before your own grandfather. His grandchildren (my grandfather and his brothers) all served our country in World War I and World War II. His great-grandson, my father, served in the U.S. Army and, coincidentally, was one of the first Mexican federal judges ever appointed to the federal bench. But the most telling and poignant line from Vela s letter was a good, old fashioned smackdown: Mr. Trump, you re a racist and you can take your border wall and shove it up your ass. This is by far the best response to Trump from any elected official. You know they all want to say it, but finally someone had the guts to actually come out and do it.And that s exactly what Donald Trump can do. Even if he were to be elected, there is no feasible way a wall would be built on the Mexican border and be financed by the Mexican government.Vela represents Texas 34th Congressional District, which makes up Corpus Christie and Brownsville. According to Census data, 60 percent of Corpus Christie s population is of Hispanic or Latino descent. In Brownsville, a border city, the Hispanic/Latino population accounted for 93 percent of its citizens.The proud people of Hispanic and Latino heritage of Texas 34th district can take solace in knowing they are being represented by a man who speaks for them to the fullest extent.

Senior Airman Brian Kolfage Jr is a good friend and recipient of the WWP s 2014 George C. Lang Award for Courage.The George C. Lang Award for Courage PRESENTED TO BRIAN KOLFAGE Jr. from Brian on Vimeo.Sales from the newly released DVD of American Sniper are expected to generate a million dollars for the Wounded Warrior Project (WWP), a charitable organization founded to honor and empower U.S. veterans and armed service members who incurred a physical or mental injury after 9/11.A Warner Bros. production company statement says that one dollar of each purchase of the DVD, between its release on Tuesday and December 31, will be donated to WWP, up to $1 million from sales.American Sniper was based on the autobiography of Chris Kyle, a runaway bestseller which spent 18 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, 13 of those at number one. Kyle is thought to have been the most lethal Navy SEAL sniper in American history with 160 confirmed kills.The blockbuster film, which was unabashedly pro-War on Terror, was a massive box office success and out-grossed every other film released in 2014, including The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 and Guardians of the Galaxy. The film grossed some $543 million worldwide.According to The Christian Post, Kyle personally wanted Clint Eastwood to direct the film, and after his tragic death the producers approached Eastwood who agreed to sign on as director of the project.Together with his friend, Chad Littlefield, Kyle was shot and killed by a Marine that he was trying to help overcome PTSD while at a Texas gun range in 2013, not long before the film went into production.Chris Kyle was a Christian whose father served as a deacon and whose mother taught Sunday school. He believed in the morality of what he did as a Navy SEAL sniper, and felt that on Judgment Day he would have things to answer for, but that his service as a SEAL wouldn t be one of them. In his autobiography, Kyle wrote:I believe the fact that I ve accepted Jesus as my savior will be my salvation. But in that backroom or whatever it is when God confronts me with my sins, I do not believe any of the kills I had during the war will be among them. Everyone I shot was evil. I had good cause on every shot. They all deserved to die.',\n",

              " 'The pace of approvals for nuclear reactor restarts in Japan, where most plants remain shut following the Fukushima disaster, is unlikely to pick up in the coming years, the new head of Japan s nuclear regulator said in an interview on Tuesday. The comments from Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) Chairman Toyoshi Fuketa suggest Japan may not make headway in meeting its electricity generation targets. By 2030, the country was expecting nuclear to power about one-fifth of its generation. However, utilities are having difficulty grappling with tougher rules on protecting reactors from natural disasters in the earthquake-prone country. Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, the world s worst since Chernobyl in 1986, the NRA was set up in 2012 to draft new safety standards that have been described as among the world s toughest. Since then, 12 reactors at six nuclear plants have passed the safety requirements needed to restart, but only four reactors are currently operating. One more reactor that resumed operations after meeting the requirements has been shut down for scheduled maintenance. Most of the approvals have been for reactors in western Japan and not on the east coast where Tokyo Electric Power Co s Fukushima Daiichi station was located. The plant suffered multiple reactor meltdowns after an earthquake on the northeast coast caused a tsunami that swamped the site. We have accumulated experience in safety reviews, but comparatively speaking, many of the plants in eastern Japan that we are reviewing now have difficult natural conditions, Fuketa, 60, said in the interview. It s doubtful the pace of approvals would quicken. A majority of Japanese oppose nuclear power after Fukushima and restarts are a delicate political issue rather than just a matter of meeting technical safety requirements. When asked if he could place a number of how many reactors may be approved for a resumption of operations in the next five years, Fuketa said: I honestly do not know. About a dozen other reactors are going through safety checks as part of a relicensing process under the new rules. Fuketa is known for taking tough positions during safety reviews of reactors and has been instrumental in directing the clean-up of the wrecked Fukushima plant. Japan s government set an energy mix plan in 2015 that forecasts relying on nuclear power to generate between 20 to 22 percent of the country s electricity in 2030. That requires having about 30 reactors operating by then. Japan s nine regional power utilities and a wholesaler, Japan Atomic Power Co, have 42 nuclear reactors for commercial use, with a total generating capacity of 41,482 megawatts.',\n",

The justices left in place a decision by a federal district judge in Michigan who in July suspended a law that abolished straight-ticket voting, the practice of using one mark to vote for all candidates from one party, finding that it would disproportionately affect black voters. The 6th U.S. Court of Appeals upheld that finding last month, prompting the state to seek a stay from the Supreme Court. Two conservative justices on the eight-member court, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, voted to grant the request, the brief order said. The Michigan law, passed by a Republican-controlled legislature and signed by a Republican governor, was one of numerous voting measures passed at the state level that put new restrictions on voting. These measures also include stricter voter-identification laws and reduction of early-voting periods before election day. Proponents of the law, enacted in January, have said most states have moved away from a straight-ticket voting option. Removing the option forces voters to study candidates and encourages voters to make decisions based on criteria other than party affiliation, they said. Opponents say voting restrictions are aimed at reducing turnout of minorities, who are more likely to vote for Democrats. U.S. District Judge Gershwin Drain in July granted a preliminary injunction sought by civil rights and labor groups who sued Michigan\\'s Secretary of State Ruth Johnson and Attorney General Bill Schuette. The judge said elimination of straight-ticket voting would be a burden on voting rights and cause long wait times at polls. After Friday\\'s decision, Schuette said, \"It is my duty to defend Michigan\\'s laws, in this case a law that stands in 40 other states. Now the U.S. Supreme Court has spoken and I will respect that decision.\" The case is one of several voting disputes being litigated ahead of the election and is the second emergency application the Supreme Court has recently been asked to handle. On Aug. 31, the court rejected a bid by North Carolina to reinstate for November\\'s elections several voting restrictions, including a requirement that people show identification at the polls. The high court is short one justice following the death of conservative Antonin Scalia in February. As a result the court is evenly split 4-4 between liberals and conservatives.',\n",

              " 'Alabama Governor Robert Bentley said on Thursday he would not resign after the state\\'s ethics commission found probable cause that he violated ethics and campaign finance laws, a ruling that could result in criminal charges. The second-term Republican governor faces a hearing in separate proceedings on Monday that could lead to his eventual impeachment and ouster. The probable cause findings by the Alabama Ethics Commission prompted Republican Del Marsh, the leader of the state Senate, to call on Bentley to step down, local media reported. Marsh said the governor was not able to lead effectively. Bentley faces escalating political fallout over his relationship with a former senior adviser and has been dogged for the past year by questions concerning his potentially inappropriate use of state resources. Asked for a response to Marsh\\'s comments, Bentley said in a statement: \"I have no intentions of resigning and I am looking forward to continuing to work on important issues facing the state.\" The Alabama House of Representatives\\' Judiciary Committee will begin the impeachment process on Monday, said its chairman, Representative Mike Jones. \"It\\'s time to put this in front of us, let\\'s address it, and let\\'s get it behind us,\" Jones said on the floor of the House on Thursday. The committee will make a recommendation to the full House on whether to impeach Bentley. The judiciary committee has been conducting its own investigation apart from the ethics commission and plans to issue a report on Friday. Bentley denies any legal wrongdoing. \"We think there is not a basis that the governor violated any law,\" his lawyer, Bill Athanas, told reporters Wednesday night. \"So the battle goes on.\" After allegations of a scandal broke last year, Bentley apologized for making inappropriate remarks to married staffer Rebekah Mason, while denying allegations of a physical affair. Mason resigned as questions about the pair\\'s relationship began to dominate Alabama politics. Bentley\\'s wife filed for divorce in August 2015 after 50 years of marriage, citing unspecified problems. Local media said the ethics commission found probable cause that Bentley violated state campaign regulations by accepting a contribution and making a loan to his campaign outside the time frame permitted by law and using campaign funds to pay Mason\\'s legal fees. He also may have violated ethics law by using public resources for his personal interest. If charged with breaking Alabama\\'s ethics or campaign finance laws, Bentley could 20 years in prison per violation, the commission said.',\n",
              " 'American intelligence agencies believe that the Russian government was behind the theft of emails and documents from the Democratic National Committee, but many questions remain about how the documents made their way to WikiLeaks, which released them. Before the WikiLeaks release, a large sampling was published by several news organizations and a hacker called Guccifer 2. 0, who investigators now believe was an agent of the G. R. U. Russia\\'s military intelligence service. American intelligence agencies say the earlier leaks from Guccifer and the WikiLeaks material have the same bits of code and telltale metadata traced to previous intrusions attributed to the G. R. U. or the F. S. B. another Russian spy agency. However, Julian Assange, the editor of WikiLeaks, makes a distinction between the Democratic National Committee material he released and the earlier releases by Guccifer and others, saying there is no proof that the Russians gave him the documents. In recent weeks, Mr. Assange has threatened to take his revelations to a new level. In August, some of the National Security Agency\\'s source code for breaking into foreign computer systems â€” the holy grail of the N. S. A. \\'s Tailored Access Operations unit â€” was revealed on a website, with the announcement of an auction for the remainder of it. Mr. Assange then declared he would soon publish the rest on WikiLeaks free. So far he has not. Most experts say the code â€” the digital equivalent of codes for the release of weapons â€” could have come only from one of two sources: another N. S. A. insider like Edward J. Snowden or, more likely, an external computer server that the N. S. A. \\'s artists used in the course of an operation. If they had left their digital tool kit on that server, and the Russians or another power was already inside that network, the code would have been stolen. The N. S. A. has not said whether the code released was real or where it came from. This week, suspicions of Russian tampering took a new turn with reports that earlier this summer, the F. B. I. warned election officials in Arizona about Russian hackers targeting systems there. The Senate minority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, asked the F. B. I. to investigate, writing to the director, James B. Comey, that the threat of Russian interference \"is more extensive than is widely known and may include the intent to falsify official election results. \" The administration has stopped short of publicly accusing the Russian government of engineering the theft of the Democratic National Committee emails, presumably to buy time for President Obama to make a decision. James R. Clapper Jr. the director of national intelligence, said last month that American spy agencies were not yet prepared to publicly identify a culprit.',\n",

Just found out that Obama had my wires tapped in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017Trump offered zero evidence to back up his claims and both former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and current FBI Director James Comey have forcefully refuted Trump s accusation.And now Rubio, who is on the Senate Intelligence Committee, says that Trump will have to answer for his lies. I have no evidence and no one has presented anything to me that indicates anything like that, Rubio told Meet The Press on Sunday. Suffice it to say I don t have any basis, I ve never heard that allegation made before by anybody. I ve never seen anything about that anywhere before. But again, the president put that out there, and now the White House will have to answer as to exactly what he was referring to. Chuck Todd went on t ask Rubio if he would concede that if Trump is lying that it would be a huge political scandal and Rubio agreed.Here s the video via YouTube:Trump is desperate to distract everyone from focusing on his ever-growing Russia scandal, so he made up this lie based on a conspiracy theory he read on Breitbart in the hopes that Congress and the media will shift their focus.This is a serious accusation against a former president and Trump should be severely punished for it. He has offered no evidence to prove his claim and that means he is slandering President Obama, which should result in a lawsuit and impeachment. But we all know that Republicans in Congress have zero credibility so they will more than likely shield Trump and pursue a witch hunt against Obama, who was a more honorable and respected president than Trump will ever be.',\n",
              " 'Nothing betrays your official narrative that your administration is functionally well and you are not a crook like tweeting assurances from Fox News that your chances of being impeached are only slim. One might argue that frantically insisting that you are probably not going to get impeached only makes the notion that you probably are all the more reasonable. No sane president would get caught doing something so desperate.But Trump woke up and did just that.In another humdinger to add to a series of self-owns, Trump retweeted a video of Fox News host Geraldo Rivera insisting that Trump s chances of being impeached went from 3 percent (a number he pulled out of thin air) to 0 percent (another number he pulled out of thin air). In doing so, Trump inadvertently acknowledged that his chances of being impeached weren t zero before and are only zero now if you listen to the network that operates as state media for his administration.Trump s self-incrimination is a nice reminder of how troubled his administration is. In an effort to spin the testimony of the former FBI director he recently inappropriately fired, he is reduced to leaning on Fox News to make the case that the hearing didn t prove he was trying to obstruct justice (as most neutral observers noted) but actually it vindicates him somehow. It s a line of spin so patently absurd that even conservative pundits are having a hard time trumpeting it with a straight face.Enter Rivera. The longtime shockjock is, of course, among the least reputable men in journalism. His legendary fails include botching the opening of Al Capone s vault on live television, getting kicked out of Iraq after revealing U.S. troop positions to the enemy on live television, and saying Travyon Martin brought his murder on himself for wearing a hoodie on live television. Put Rivera in front of a camera, broadcast it live, and chances are he will do something to humiliate himself. He has become one of Trump s biggest defenders.It says something about Trump s chances of making it through his first term without being thrown out of office that he s just a few months in and already he s been reduced to using disreputable Fox hosts like Rivera to defend him. The fact that nobody else will risk destroying their reputation to stand up for him speaks volumes. Luckily, Trump is just dimwitted enough to keep reminding us of his precarious situation because he is fundamentally incapable of not tweeting incredibly stupid things each day.',\n",

              " 'President Barack Obama and the deputy crown prince of Saudi Arabia on Friday discussed ways to support Iraqis in their fight against Islamic State militants and the importance of a political transition in war-torn Syria, the White House said. Obama met with Mohammed bin Salman in the Oval office for about an hour. The deputy crown prince is visiting the United States to repair frayed relations and to promote a plan, known as Vision 2030, to slash the kingdom\\'s dependence on oil exports. \"The President expressed appreciation for Saudi Arabia\\'s contributions to the campaign against ISIL,\" the White House said, using an acronym for the Islamic State group. The two talked about steps to support Iraqis \"including increased Gulf support to fund urgent humanitarian and stabilization needs,\" the White House said. U.S. officials have expressed unease about the Saudi-led campaign against Houthi rebels in Yemen, which according to the United Nations and human rights groups has resulted in large numbers of civilian casualties. Saudi Arabia is worried about closer relations between the United States and Iran, Riyadh\\'s arch enemy, after a 2015 nuclear deal. Obama welcomed Saudi Arabia\\'s commitment to a political settlement of the Yemen conflict and support by the Gulf Cooperation Council, of which the kingdom is a member, to address humanitarian needs and rebuild the country, the White House said. On Syria, Obama and the prince talked about the importance of supporting a political transition away from President Bashar al-Assad, the White House said. The United States is working with international partners on what it calls a Syrian-led transition process facilitated by the United Nations, but so far there has been little progress. Over 50 diplomats at the U.S. State Department signed a memo, leaked on Thursday, that was critical of the Obama administration\\'s Syria policy and called for targeted military strikes against Assad\\'s government. Asked about the memo, Saudi Arabia\\'s Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, also in Washington, told reporters the kingdom had been arguing for a \"more robust intervention\" including airstrikes, a no-fly zone, and a no-drive zone, from the beginning of the five-year civil war. Obama does not see a military solution to the crisis in Syria, White House spokeswoman Jen Friedman said. Both Washington and Riyadh are anticipating the release of classified pages of a U.S. report into the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, that some U.S. lawmakers have alleged link Saudi government officials to the attacks.

Prof. Hall has been the target of a witch hunt mounted by Facebook and by B\\'nai Brith Canada. The mission of the Canadian branch of the Anti-Defamation League is to provide Zionist advocacy for \"the security of Israel.\" In late August of 2016 a maliciously engineered smear item was placed on Prof. Hall\\'s FB page without his knowledge or consent. The B\\'nai Brith immediately publicized the offensive content of the post to introduce a concerted smear and disinformation campaign implying falsely that Dr. Hall seeks to \"Kill All Jews.\" The B\\'nai Brith exploited its grotesque misrepresentation of Dr. Hall\\'s academic work to call on its membership to flood the administrative offices of the University of Lethbridge with letters and petition signatures. The object is to remove Dr. Hall from his teaching post. Dr. Hall remains a tenured full professor whose career as a university teacher began in 1982. The University of Lethbridge\\'s administration soon surrendered to this Zionist campaign aimed at disabling an outspoken critic of Israel\\'s genocidal treatment of the Aboriginal Palestinians. On Oct. 4 the U of L president, Dr. Mike Mahon, suspended Dr. Hall without pay. He undertook this assault on the principles of academic freedom in the complete absence of any due process of third-party arbitration whatsoever. The attack on Dr. Hall is an attack on the institution of academic tenure, a mainstay of protection for academic freedom in institutions of higher learning. The University of Lethbridge Faculty Association and the Canadian Association of University Teachers have identified the illegal nature of Dr. Mahon\\'s unprecedented assault on the core principles of tenure and academic freedom. In his talk sponsored by the Mohawks of the Grand River, Dr. Hall put the Zionist/Facebook campaign directed at disabling critics of Israel in a broader historical context. The assault on the Palestinian people extends the genocidal holocaust directed at the Indigenous peoples of the Americas since 1492. Israeli techniques directed at terminating the Palestinian presence draw on the genocidal techniques directed at Native Americans in the expansionary course of US history.

              " 'Pope Francis issued a stinging new critique of the Vatican s top administration on Thursday, saying traitors stood in the way of his reforms and made any change as hard as cleaning Egypt s Sphinx with a toothbrush . For the fourth year running, Francis used his annual Christmas greetings to the Roman Catholic Church s central bureaucracy, or Curia, to lecture the assembled cardinals, bishops and other department heads on the need for change. Reforming Rome is like cleaning the Sphinx of Egypt with a toothbrush, he said, quoting a 19th-century Belgian churchman. The phrase did not evoke much laughter when the pope read it in the frescoed Clementina Hall of the Vatican s Apostolic Palace. Since his election as the first Latin American pope in 2013, Francis has been trying to reform the Italian-dominated Curia to bring the Church s hierarchy closer to its members, to enact financial reforms and guide it out of scandals that marked the pontificate of his predecessor, former Pope Benedict. But he has encountered resistance, particularly as some departments have been closed, merged or streamlined. Francis said some in the bureaucracy - the nerve center of the 1.2-billion-member Church and whose members are entrusted with carrying out the pope s decisions - were part of cliques and plots . Francis called this unbalanced and degenerate and a cancer that leads to a self-referential attitude . In his address on Thursday, he spoke of those traitors of trust who had been entrusted with carrying out reforms but let themselves be corrupted by ambition and vainglory. When they are quietly let go, he said, they erroneously declare themselves to be martyrs of the system ... instead of reciting a mea culpa (Latin for my fault ). Francis did not cite any specific examples. Last June the Vatican s first auditor general resigned suddenly. He later said he was forced to step down because he had discovered irregularities but the Vatican said he had been spying on his superiors. Earlier this month, the Vatican bank s deputy director was fired under circumstances that have not been explained. In July, in a major shake-up of the Vatican administration, Francis replaced Catholicism s top theologian, a conservative German cardinal who has been at odds with the pontiff s vision of a more inclusive Church. Francis said the overwhelming majority of Curia members were faithful, competent and some saintly. Later, in a separate meeting with lay Vatican employees and their families, Francis asked forgiveness for the failings of some Church officials. He spoke hours before the funeral of Cardinal Bernard Law, the ex-Archbishop of Boston who resigned in disgrace after covering up years of sexual abuse of children by priests and whose name became a byword for scandal in the Catholic Church.',\n",

The data I've sent are calibrated over the period 1881-1960 against the instrumental Apr-Sep tempratures averaged over all land grid boxes (that have observed data) that are north of 20N. As such, the mean of our reconstruction over 1881-1960 matches the mean of the observed target series over the same period. Since the observed series consists of degrees C anomalies wrt to 1961-90, we say that the reconstructed series also represents degrees C anomalies wrt to 1961-90.

I've been trying to lose weight for six months now and have made pretty good progress. As with any weight loss program it all comes down to eating right, exercising and supplements. Ive never been good at going to the gym so I decided to buy products like this so I can easily workout at my house. So my routine includes pullups, resistance band exercises, pushups and cardio. The cardio helps me to get in shape and burn fat, I usually do some sprints/intervals or some longer distance running. the exercise bands, pushups and pullups help to build muscle and define the muscle. And then the ab wheel helps with my core, keeping a strong core is very important in running as well as just normal day life. I work at a desk so ad exercises help a ton with keeping good posture in a very sedentary job. The ab wheel is NOT easy, I know some people may see it and think they wont get a workout but if you do it right and keep good form you will most certainly feel it. After the first few times using it I was sore for the next day! NOT easy. But if you want results thats what you need. On top of my current workout needs i have also been eating healthy. This healthy eating is mainly towards losing weight so thats the focus of many of my habits. For instance upon waking up I drink a protein shake and eat a banana for breakfast, protein is great in the morning when you are trying to lose weight. 30g within 30 min of waking up is ideal. In total I stick to about 2200 calories a day and try and stay away from processed foods although sometimes it is tough. I also take a supplement called which help you lose more weight by burning more fat and raising your metabolism. That combined with the protein shake in the morning help a ton. The protein also has the effect of keeping you fuller longer which helps me make it to lunch time without craving snacks.\",\n",

The Financial Times also notes that Toyota has already pledged another $10 billion in U. S. investment over the next five years, with up to 400 jobs added at its Indiana manufacturing plant. Japan\\'s SoftBank tech conglomerate has also pledged $50 billion in American investment over the next four years. Abe will add to this by discussing Japanese investment for Trump\\'s proposed infrastructure plan, possibly including a sales pitch for Japanese rail technology. In 2015, Abe proposed $5 billion in Japanese investment for a maglev train that would have offered travel from D. C. to Baltimore in 15 minutes, with a vision of similar lines connecting New York to Washington, Dallas to Houston, and Los Angeles to San Francisco.',\n",
              " \"David Duke is a former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard who also happens to be one of the most famous white supremacists in modern history. He is also, like many white supremacists, anti-semites, and other assorted despicable bigots, a Donald Trump supporter. Today, as we all know by now, Hillary Clinton issued a blistering takedown of Trump in a brilliant speech delivered in Reno, Nevada. She indicted the so-called alt-right movement which is really nothing more than the new white supremacy as well as Donald Trump himself for being nothing more than bigots, and bringing their bigotry into the mainstream via this presidential election. Well, of course, David Duke was most unhappy with this, and decided to issue a statement defending the alt-right which of course means, at this point, that he is also defending Trump.Duke talked to Buzzfeed s Andrew Kaczynski and said:Kaczynski went on to tweet:Bottom line, the white nationalists trust Trump and don't find his condemnations of them to be sincere. andrew kaczynski (@BuzzFeedAndrew) August 26, 2016He s right, of course. They know that Trump is just doing what he has to do to get elected. He is their guy. They know that all of his pathetic and disingenuous attempts to reach out to communities of color is really just lip service; hell, he isn t even actually talking to communities of color. He s trying to assure more mainstream white people that he isn t quite as racist as they thought, and that they should still vote for him, because he s still their man.Trump s campaign has completely embraced the lunatic fringe, and they are welcoming him with open arms. No matter how much his campaign staff tries to soften his bombastic tone and gets him to read off of a teleprompter, the truth is already out there, via not just Trump s own words, associations, and actions, but also via the full throated endorsement and defense of Klan leaders and other white supremacist leaders like David Duke.GOP, if you ve any sense at all, you ll kick ALL of these racists out of your party. You can t just say you aren t racists. You have to prove it. Take the hit this election, and reject Trumpism before it is too late.\",\n",

Gaetz: \"I am immediately calling for an investigation into the special treatment that the FBI gave Hillary Clinton.\" #IngrahamAngle pic.twitter.com/EHkQfyeWDK Fox News (@FoxNews) November 22, 2017Ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee Goetz is calling for an investigation into why Hillary Clinton s FBI case was labelled special by the FBI s Andrew McCabe:The Hill reports:Shortly before last year s election, FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe wrote an email on his official government account stating that the Hillary Clinton email probe had been given special status, according to documents released Wednesday.McCabe s Oct. 23, 2016, email to press officials in the FBI said the probe was under the control of a small group of high-ranking people at the FBI s headquarters in Washington. As I now know the decision was made to investigate it at HQ with a small team, McCabe wrote in the email. He said he had no input when the Clinton email investigation started in summer 2015, while he was serving as assistant director in charge of the FBI s Washington office. [The Washington office] provided some personnel for the effort but it was referred to as a special and I was not given any details about it, he wrote.FBI officials on Wednesday night refused to answer what McCabe meant by calling the Clinton email probe a special or why it was restricted to a small team at headquarters when it began. We don t have anything to add to the documents that were released, bureau spokeswoman Carol Cratty wrote The Hill.The note was contained in more than 70 pages of emails the FBI released on its public records site known as The Vault.The emails chronicled McCabe s efforts to address a separate controversy involving his wife s 2015 campaign for political office.McCabe s references to a special status for the Clinton probe are likely to be used as ammunition by Republican lawmakers critical of former FBI Director James Comey s handling of the Clinton investigation.Remember that the DOJ s Loretta Lynch also wanted Clinton s case to be called an incident and not an investigation. It looks like all intel agencies were doing all they could to protect Clinton. Was it to save themselves from exposure in the Uranium One case or something else?',\n",

[Frederick County Public Schools has fired employee Katie Nash after she stirred up attention on how she ran the district\\'s Twitter feed last week, the Frederick News Post reported. On Jan. 5, a student tweeted to the FCPS Twitter account @FCPSMaryland and said, \"close school tammarow PLEASE. \" Several hours later, Frederick County Public Schools Social Media Manager Katie Nash replied, \"but then how would you learn how to spell \\'tomorrow?\\' :)\" The response drew lots of attention and backlash over social media as thousands of people liked and retweeted the post. She eventually became the subject of a hashtag, #KatiefromFCPS, and later #freekatie when WHAG reported that her Twitter was taken away from her. Nash said she understands why she was fired and said she doesn\\'t want to be a \"distraction\" to the school system, but thought her employer would have provided some suggestions on how to improve her job. \"As a new employee, I think I sort of would have expected that there would have been some counseling or some suggestions on how to improve,\" she said. Nash had decided to take a more playful tone on the school\\'s Twitter account, citing student feedback. \"We had received feedback from some students in a focus group that our tweeting was a bit flat, they were looking for some more engagement,\" Nash said. \"They were looking for us to tweet back at them and I really took that to heart because I know that I am a little bit older and maybe not as hip as some of the students are, so I took that to heart and I took that feedback in. \" The student later said that he didn\\'t take the tweet personally, WGHP reported.

According to Kenneth Meshoe, chairman of the African Christian Democratic Party faction, any attempt to compare Palestinians\\' experience in Israel with the former racist regime is offensive to individuals who suffered under the system of racial separation.  Whatever challenges the Arab minority in Israel faces, the reality of life here cannot be compared to his experiences growing up, he insists.  \"There is freedom of movement in this country that we never had in South Africa,\" Meshoe told Tazpit Press Service (TPS) during a visit to Jerusalem last week. \"Benches and bathrooms said \\'whites only.\\' We could never take \\'white\\' transportation. Most white doctors would not treat black patients, only white ones. And those who were willing to treat black patients out of compassion â€“ many of them would ask the patients to enter their clinics through the back door so they wouldn\\'t be seen by the white patients in the lobby. I don\\'t know if it was illegal for white doctors to treat black patients, but the reality was that very few did.\" \\'Perpetuating Propaganda\\'  According to Meshoe, \"Some South Africans who say there\\'s apartheid in Israel are only repeating things they\\'ve heard from other people, not because they\\'ve actually seen it themselves. They are just perpetuating propaganda.  \"Other people â€“ politicians â€“ are only thinking about their needs, and the statements that will serve their needs. They ask \\'what do I gain [by claiming there is or is not apartheid in Israel] and then make a decision. So they are perpetuating something that that they know very well is a lie.\"  Meshoe said he first visited Israel several years after Nelson Mandela was elected president in 1994. He joined a church delegation to the Holy Land and used the opportunity both for a religious pilgrimage and a political education, but the latter came as a surprise.  \"On that trip, I deliberately looked for anything that looked like apartheid.

              " 'With a bitter election campaign finally over, the Congress will reconvene this week to try to set aside its partisan differences long enough to keep the government from closing. As President-elect Donald Trump shapes his administration, Republicans are expected to move away from initial plans for compromise funding legislation and opt instead for a short-term measure to keep the government running into next year, when they will have control of Congress and the White House. Washington has been operating since Oct. 1 under a temporary \"continuing resolution\" on the budget. It expires on Dec. 9. Lawmakers will be trying to approve a new one before then. Mired in partisan gridlock, Congress in recent years has seldom completed the entire federal budget process, falling back frequently on stop-gap measures that last a few months. During their \"lame-duck\" session starting this week, lawmakers will have little time to draft another continuing resolution to cover funding U.S. agencies and military operations. Congress is tentatively set to adjourn by Dec. 17 and has an additional break over the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. A new Congress will meet in January, with the 100-seat Senate more closely split than before last week\\'s elections. Neither party will have the 60 votes needed to move legislation easily through the chamber. The voters last Tuesday also preserved the Republican majority in the House of Representatives, though it is slightly smaller, giving the Democrats more power to block the Republicans. Legislation to streamline federal regulations for new drugs could come up during the lame duck session. So could funding for cancer research, precision medicine and treatments for opioid addiction, said congressional aides. Some conservative House Republicans want a budget measure that will expire in March, which would coincide with needed action on the federal debt limit, according to House aides. Others have talked about a continuing resolution that would run until sometime February, giving the new president and Congress enough time to determine their priorities for more comprehensive funding legislation for the remainder of the federal fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30. Before the election shifted the political center of gravity in favor of Republicans, Republican leaders had talked about crafting funding legislation through negotiations with Democrats and President Barack Obama and approving it before Christmas.',\n",

              " 'We bought this for our outdoor plants before we disappeared for a week to a vacation. At that time, weather here was dry and hot and no rain was forecast for the whole week, so we needed to provide the plants with some water. The watering system worked as it should - when we came back, the plants were alive and looked rather well. Set-up of the system is very easy, but due to the limited length of the water hose, you either need to compile your plants within the reach of this unit, or you have to buy more than one unit. Our plants that needed the week long water treatment are all moveable, so we clustered them in an area of approximately 5 by 5 feet directly adjacent to the solar unit, which we attached to a rain pipe with the provided plastic bands. Of course, being solar powered, it is paramount that the unit has access to sunlight, but in pour case this was only true for maybe four hours a day in the afternoon. Still, this and the rechargeable batteries you need to put in (not provided!) kept the unit going. Another consideration is the flow rate of the water, which can be chosen variably. But the more water you let flow through the system, the bigger your tank has to be. Not everybody has a 50 gallon drum readily available, and we eventually had to settle for an old 20 gallon plastic container. we set the flow rate to a very low level and calculated that this would do the trick. It did. When we came back, the container was only half empty and our precious hibiscus and the other plants were in great shape. So, this is certainly not a 1-2-3 solution - it needs a bit planning and preparation with placement, water supply and flow rate, but once you have figured it all out, it works perfectly. We did not bother to remove the system after we got back from our vacation, but left it - and the plants - in place. It just looked good the way the plants were arranged - though more out of necessity than of aesthetic reasons at first - andthe solar powered unit, after over one month of constant use, still supplies them with a steady stream of water. Out of our experience, we can highly recommend this product.',\n",
              " 'Germany would take advantage of any trade opportunities in Asia and South America left by a protectionist United States, Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said, after U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). \"If Trump starts a trade war with Asia and South America, it will open opportunities for us,\" Gabriel told Handelsblatt newspaper in an interview published on Tuesday. \"Trump must simply recognize that the U.S. economy often isn\\'t competitive, while the German (economy) is,\" he said, criticizing Trump\\'s threat to impose a 35 percent tariff on German cars imported from Mexico. Trump signed an executive order formally withdrawing from the 12-nation TPP on Monday, following through on a promise made during his election campaign. He called the move a \"great thing for the American worker\". Gabriel - Economy Minister and leader of the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), who is expected to run against Chancellor Angela Merkel in September\\'s election - said German industry should remain confident in the face of Trump\\'s moves. Barely 10 percent of German exports go to the United States, Gabriel said, while 60 percent go to other countries in Europe. \"You can see the weight of our economic interests,\" said Gabriel. \"Germany should act with self-confidence and not be fearful or servile.\" \"We are a highly successful, technologically advanced export nation with many hard-working people and smart companies.\" Bernd Lange, a Social Democrat and chairman of the trade committee in the European Parliament, told broadcaster rbb that Germany and the European Union should look into expanding trade with China and other countries. \"We must certainly speak with China because it is trying to jump into the gap left by the United States, even if they have other practices,\" he said. Lange said the European Union should also push for closer ties with countries that had similar values, including Canada, Japan and Australia.

              " \"WINDTALKERS is a good WWII movies filmed over the past few years in that brings attention to these uniquely qualified men of war to draw upon their heritage in this time of global conflict. It is a multi-layered and multi-faceted tale told visually through incredible images enhanced with armor piercing sound effects. The dialogue really has to take a back seat to this simple tale of men and their survival because the images of the land, the bleak faces and the carnage tell it all. This film is named WINDTALKERS but the film does not really focus on the code developed by the Navajo Marines. Director Raoul Walsh had peripherally addressed the Navajo code in 1955 with his film BATTLE CRY with Felix Noriego as Marine Crazy Horse where we saw Japanese operators baffled while listening in on radio and field-telephone transmissions. Director John Woo, as did Raoul Walsh, decides to focus his attention on the men and their diverse backgrounds and what makes them Marines. However, Woo narrows his focus on the relationship between a war-weary, shell-shocked and enigmatic Marine sergeant (Nicolas Cage) and a good-natured naive Navajo recruit (Adam Beach) assigned to him. Beach can't understand the actions or behavior of loner Cage's intensity for killing and bloodshed but learns eventually that if you survive you then increase your chances of having your comrades around you survive as well. Woo is a director noted for action and WINDTALKERS contains some of the most frenetically staged sequences ever filmed. These sequences reminded me of some of Sam Peckinpah's cathartic work from THE WILD BUNCH, the montages of the combat maelstrom of his CROSS OF IRON and the intensity of the intimate fighting of combatants from Edward Zwick's Civil War epic GLORY. This is not action for the sake of action that can be easily labeled on John Woo. Woo is making a statement that all this carnage can be addictive yet simultaneously it usually creates and strengthens intimate camaraderie. But you really can never afford to be close to any of your buddies and this is a highly moral conflict. Is battle weary hardness a symptom or a mechanism to survive? This is the price of defending the ideals that we hold so dear. This is a very subtle and great film that can be easily glossed right over for its true meaning and realization. WINDTALKERS draws attention to forgotten heroes.\",\n",

              " 'Austria s new conservative-far right ruling coalition is likely to be sworn in on Dec. 20, an informed source said on Friday, marking a victory for nationalists so far shut out of government elsewhere in western Europe. Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz, whose mainstream conservative People s Party (OVP) won a parliamentary election on Oct. 15 but not a majority, has been in coalition talks with Heinz-Christian Strache s Freedom Party (FPO). Both sides have described the discussions as friendly and constructive but so far failed to disclose the kind of sweeping tax, immigration and administrative reforms they had called for in their campaigns. Kurz, 31, who has taken a tough stance on immigration and Muslim parallel societies , tilting towards the FPO line as the far right surged in popularity, is tipped to become chancellor and the youngest head of government in the European Union. There has been no confirmation on who might get which portfolio in the new cabinet, but the anti-immigration FPO has said it would aim for about half of the ministries. The OVP gained 31.5 percent and the FPO 26 percent of votes in the Alpine republic s October election. (Dec. 20) is certainly a possible date (for the swearing-in), OVP Chairwoman Elisabeth Koestinger said on Oe1 radio, adding they would put quality before speed even if that meant a deal only after Christmas. FPO deputy leader Norbert Hofer told Oe1 that no deal had been sealed yet, repeating previous statements that both parties aimed to finish before Christmas. The Austrian national news agency APA also cited Dec. 20 as the most likely date for the swearing-in of the new government by President Alexander Van der Bellen, but listed Jan. 8 as an alternative date. The FPO, which came within a whisker of winning the 2015 presidential election, is allied with France s National Front and Germany s AfD, which in a September election became the third strongest party in Germany s parliament. The populist far right last entered an Austrian federal government in 2000 and currently rules in coalition with centrists in two of the country s provinces.',\n",
              " 'Donald Trump, under pressure to show a more presidential image, elevated a top adviser on Thursday and said he planned to hire additional staff to prepare for the possibility of a long fight for the Republican nomination. The developments came as Trump tries to rebound from a loss in Wisconsin on Tuesday to U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a defeat that punctured the billionaire businessman\\'s aura of inevitability and made it more likely the nominee will be picked in a floor fight at the Republican National Convention in July. The Republican front-runner\\'s stumble in Wisconsin exposed a variety of weaknesses. Trump alienated many female Republican voters by saying that women who have an abortion if the procedure were banned should be punished, a position he later backtracked on. He also appeared to have been outmaneuvered in the scramble for delegates in Louisiana. Although Trump beat Cruz in that state on March 5, Cruz may end up with more delegates from Louisiana than Trump. Trump announced that he has assigned all functions related to the nomination process to veteran political operative Paul Manafort, who was hired to manage the process of corralling delegates who will pick the nominee. \"The nomination process has reached a point that requires someone familiar with the complexities involved in the final stages,\" Trump said. Trump also canceled plans for a campaign swing through California in coming days in order to concentrate on New York, which has suddenly emerged as a must-win state for him on April 19. He has a big lead in his home state. A Trump campaign statement said that he will add to his team as the Republican National Convention nears and that he would announce new hires in the weeks ahead. The expansion of Trump\\'s campaign means his team will grow beyond the close-knit group of advisers who have been at his side since he jumped into the presidential race last June. Trump said he plans to open a Washington office next week. While there has been speculation that Trump might make Manafort his campaign manager, the candidate\\'s statement made clear that current campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and deputy manager Michael Glassner would remain in their positions. Lewandowski has been charged with simple battery for grabbing a reporter who tried to ask Trump a question in Florida a month ago. Trump, famously loyal to people he trusts, has rejected calls that he fire Lewandowski.',\n",

              " 'Using the long-debunked Planned Parenthood videos that were heavily edited to show the sale of fetal tissue, House Republicans have decided that if they can t punish PP, they would terrorize researchers instead:WASHINGTON A special House committee empaneled to investigate fetal tissue research is preparing to issue 17 subpoenas to medical supply companies and laboratories, seeking the names of researchers, graduate students, laboratory technicians and administrative personnel.The House investigation into how some of the nation s most prestigious universities acquire fetal tissue has prompted charges of intimidation and coercion, escalating a battle that some researchers fear could shut down studies seeking cures for Parkinson s disease, the Zika virus and a host of other conditions.Republicans know full well that the donation of aborted fetal tissue is perfectly legal and vitally necessary to life-saving research. But this is an election year, so they re willfully putting that same life-saving research in jeopardy just to feed red meat to their idiot base.If you listen carefully, you can already hear the so-called pro-life movement flexing their fingers, ready to start typing death threats to any researchers that have their names revealed. But don t call them domestic terrorists! They re just using fear and violence to get their way.Keep in mind, these researchers are literally saving millions of lives by curing diseases and discovering ways to fix traumatic damage to the human body. But once their names are forced into the public square, they will be called murderers and monsters by people who think the height of morality is screaming at teenage girls trying to get rid of their rapist s fetus.Even worse, if Republicans get their way, it s only a matter of time until some crazed, but somehow still responsible, gun owner goes on a rampage and shoots up a research facility to save the murdered babies or some such stupidity. Or maybe someone will just set the lab on fire. Or try to blow it up. The fact that they could be killing the person that cures cancer or destroying the research that could have ended birth defects won t even occur to them.This kind of short-term irresponsibility is all Republicans know how to do anymore. Exposing these people s names to the violent pro-life movement is a recipe for disaster but a surefire way to get votes.

              " 'Paul Ryan and the Republican leadership are rolling out plans to keep wages stagnant in America for the foreseeable future. A $23 billion cut is aimed at eliminating food benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to people on unemployment who are either in school or job training. It s an age-old GOP tactic. Eliminate the help for people who are looking to do better and they are forced out of school or training and into minimum wage jobs.Once they get there, the Republicans can claim they re teenagers living at home for free and it s their own fault for settling for a minimum wage job when all they have to do is go back to school or get some training. And the cycle continues. According to Roll Call:Republican leaders have proposed more than $23 billion in food stamp cuts in a budget plan that could be brought to the House floor in the next two weeks, several sources say.The proposed changes in the food stamp, or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, include the end of waivers that allow some adults to receive assistance for a limited amount of time, while they are in school, or training for a job.$23 billion in cuts to food for people. Is there nowhere else we could look for $23 billion dollars? How over budget is that fighter jet program again? We re not talking about handing people cash outside a liquor store here; we re talking about food. All the BS about fraud and dependence and still one in four children in this country struggle with food. Republicans have been after the food stamp program for no reason other than to keep people as desperate as possible.Just imagine if Donald Trump is elected with a Republican majority in Congress. Food will be distributed to the poor in the streets in the form of bags of flour and rice and maybe some milk and whey to make cheese. OK, maybe that s a little extreme. There won t be any free food. Certainly in a Trumptopian society, the poor will stay out of sight where they belong.Featured image from foodsecuritychallenge.com',\n",

              " 'Chad has withdrawn hundreds of troops from neighboring Niger, where they were helping local forces fight Boko Haram Islamist militants, humanitarian sources and officials said. The pull-out over the past two weeks could weaken a region-wide struggle against the militants who have killed tens of thousands of people, forced many more to flee and triggered a humanitarian crisis. There was no immediate explanation or comment from defense officials in Chad. But the move came a month after the vast central African country complained about an unexpected U.S. travel ban imposed on its nationals. Chad warned at the time the order could affect its security commitments - which include its involvement in the U.S.-backed fight against Boko Haram. Residents said the withdrawal had already had an impact on Niger s Diffa region, which has seen a string of attacks by Boko Haram militants crossing over from their base in neighboring Nigeria. Ibrahim Arimi from the border village of Bosso said banditry had increased since the Chadian troops started leaving and he had been temporarily moved to another village for safety. Diffa parliamentarian Lamido Moumouni said residents had started complaining. They have come to rely on the forces so there is a perception that security will be lacking, he said by telephone. At its peak in 2016 after an attack in Bosso, Chad had 2,000 troops in Niger to help counter Boko Haram although security sources said this has fallen since. Boko Haram has attacked Chad, Niger and Cameroon from its base in northeast Nigeria. Its eight-year bid to carve out an Islamist caliphate has driven millions from their homes - more than 200,000 of them are now based in Diffa, with little prospect of returning home. Thousands of them are camped alongside an unfinished highway in the middle of a barren savannah with few resources. Chad s soldiers also occupy front-line positions in a peacekeeping force in northern Mali. Falling oil revenues after the price crash in 2014 has also sapped Chad s appetite for expensive regional security commitments, analysts say.',\n",
              " 'Barack Obama and the Democrat Party were laser focused on opening the immigrant floodgates for 8 years. They re the first ones to cry when President Trump mentions budget cuts to schools and programs for the elderly, but what about the enormous burden millions of new immigrants (mostly illegal) have put on the backs of taxpayers? The Democrats were only looking at immigrants as voters, they didn t consider how the massive influx of people on entitlement programs would affect our schools and social programs. The statistics below are stunning:Children of immigrants, many in the United States illegally, make up the bulk of students in 700 of the biggest school areas, a huge and unexpected wave that is changing education and society in America, according to a groundbreaking new report.Using Census Bureau statistics and Google Maps, the Center for Immigration Studies found that in areas including northern Virginia, New York City and Houston, children of immigrants made up to 93 percent of all students. The number of children from immigrant households in schools is now so high in some areas that it raises profound questions about assimilation, said the report provided to Secrets. What s more, immigration has added enormously to the number of public school students who are in poverty and the number who speak a foreign language. This cannot help but to create significant challenges for schools, often in areas already struggling to educate students who come from disadvantaged backgrounds, it added.Overall, 23 percent of all public school students were from an immigrant household in 2015. In 1990 it was 11 percent, and in 1980 it was 7 percent.And, said the CIS report, between one-fourth and one-third of public school students from immigrant households were the children of illegal immigrants. Report author Steven Camarota said, Of course, we must educate the children of immigrants. But, added the Center s director of research, the key question moving forward is whether it makes sense to continue to admit 1 million new legal permanent immigrants each year and tolerating illegal immigration without regard to the absorption capacity of our schools in terms of both educating students and assimilating them. On a state level, he found that California has the biggest percentage of immigrant students in public schools, 48 percent, followed by Nevada, 35 percent, New Jersey and New York at 34 percent, and Texas, 31 percent.The bulk have Mexican or El Salvadoran parents.He also found that many immigrant families are poor, which cuts the tax base schools have to tap for funds.',\n",

There have long been suspicions that the Kurds, who let thousands of ISIS oil trucks through their region each week, have been working with ISIS all along. It was the Kurds, not the real Kurds, but Barzani\\'s Saudi run dictatorship in Erbil, that invited Turkey into Iraq. Deputy Chief of the Nineveh Provincial Council Noureddin Qablan announced that the US-led coalition warplanes have launched airstrikes on army base in Nineveh province, killing several soldiers. \"The US fighter jets hit one of the military bases of Iraqi Army\\'s 16th Division in a region North of Mosul, and the attack left at least four Iraqi soldiers dead,\" Qablan said. According to FNA, He said that the US army has confirmed the attack, calling it a \"mistake\". Qablan said that it is not the first time the US warplanes hit the Iraqi army and volunteer forces (Hashd al-Shaabi) military positions, adding, \"The US-led coalition has each time said that air raids were not deliberate.\" It is reported that another peshmerga convoy accidentally hit by an USA-led coalition airstrike near Mosul today.

              " 'Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga, who withdrew from a presidential election re-run set for Oct. 26 saying it should only take place once wide-ranging reforms are undertaken, urged his supporters on Sunday to hold protests. Authorities have banned protests in central Nairobi and other hotspots in a bid to keep a lid on mounting political turmoil in the build-up to the repeat vote, in which Odinga had been set to challenge President Uhuru Kenyatta once again. The Supreme Court nullified Kenyatta s victory in the original election on Aug. 8, citing procedural irregularities. On Friday, Odinga said his withdrawal meant the poll had been canceled and that there should be fresh nominations for a new vote. Come out in large numbers tomorrow like you have done today and fear no-one. This is your country and you have the right to protest, he told a crowd in the coastal city of Mombasa. The election board has said the vote will go ahead, with Kenyatta facing six other candidates, none of whom polled more than 1 percent in August. During a trip to London last week, Odinga told Reuters that he might consider returning to the Supreme Court for clarification on whether the Oct. 26 poll was legal. I went to tell our friends in London the truth of what was happening here. Jubilee should know that we are not interested in a coalition government, he said, referring to Kenyatta s party. Despite the ban, protests have taken place in the East African country a regional and trade gateway which is the region s richest economy and an important Western ally in the fight against militant Islamists. On Friday, Kenyan police shot dead two people and wounded a third when a crowd tried to storm a police station in the town of Bondo in the southwest county of Siaya during a rally. Police also used teargas to break up small demonstrations in Kenya s three main cities Kisumu, the capital and the port of Mombasa the same day, defying the ban on rallies in city centers. Hospital authorities said 20 people were injured in Kisumu, an opposition stronghold. I am ready to die for change in Kenya, James Orengo, an opposition senator and lawyer who led Odinga s successful petition at the Supreme Court, told the crowd in Mombasa, which numbered in the thousands.',\n",

[Military sources told NBC News that the U. S. has positioned two Tomahawk missiles in the Korean peninsula approximately 300 miles from where North Korea will carry out its next nuclear test. The preparations come amid rising tensions in the region, with North Korea this week promising a \"big event\" as the country prepares to celebrate the \"Day of the Sun,\" the birthday of communist dictator and \"eternal leader\" Kim .

I say he is technically the governor of Maine because the word itself implies governing as in working and doing a job. LePage does virtually none of that.The latest crusade of stupidity he has embarked upon is the outright refusal to perform his constitutional duty and swear in a new state senator, who recently won a special election. This leaves people of his state without representation in their capitol and shows yet again why the phrase tea party automatically disqualifies from any position of authority in any job.Susan Deschambault, a Biddeford Democrat, won a special election for the Senate District 32 seat on Tuesday. She traveled to the capitol with her family to be sworn in, only to be told the governor refused to do it. His reason is even worse than his behavior. LePage won t swear her in because of a totally unrelated issue where the senate has rejected the confirmation of the governor s nominee to the state s unemployment insurance commission.Deschambault literally has NOTHING to do with any of this, but he is denying her the ability to do her job, denying her constituents representation, denying Maine a fully-functional state house and violating his oath of office as governor just because he is an overgrown child who wants to have a tantrum.Tea Partiers are not the brightest bulb in the room normally. However, this move really is beyond reason even for them. We have a sitting U.S. governor who is literally holding his own state s ability to govern itself hostage until he gets his way.

              " 'U.S. lawmakers said on Monday they did not know when legislation to impose new sanctions on Russia might come up for a vote in the House of Representatives, and the White House said it had concerns about the measure. The legislation passed the Senate by a nearly unanimous margin two weeks ago, looking like it might complicate President Donald Trump\\'s desire for warmer relations with Moscow, where officials have denounced new sanctions. A White House official said the Trump administration felt some provisions in the bill would interfere with its ability to use sanctions to try to influence Russia. \"There are some provisions in the Senate bill that would unprecedentedly impair Treasury\\'s ability to wield its sanctions tools, risk endangering the transatlantic sanctions coalition, and weaken the State Department\\'s ability to credibly signal that we would calibrate our sanctions in response to Russian behavior,\" the official said in an emailed statement, requesting anonymity. Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a co-author of the legislation, said he hoped for progress within the next day or two on a procedural issue that has kept the House from taking up the Countering Iran\\'s Destabilizing Activities Act, which also includes the new sanctions against Russia. The measure must pass the House, where Trump\\'s fellow Republicans control a larger majority than in the Senate, before it can be sent for Trump to sign into law or veto. House Republican leaders said last week that the Senate bill violated a constitutional requirement that any bill affecting government revenues must originate in the House, something known as a \"blue slip\" violation. House aides also said leadership had not yet decided whether to vote on the Senate bill once the \"blue slip\" issue was resolved, or first refer it to House committees, which could further delay or change it. Democrats said they were skeptical about the \"blue slip\" explanation, noting that the issue had resolved very quickly in recent years for other bills. Corker said Senate Republicans remained solidly behind the legislation. \"I\\'ve heard no one here have second thoughts, by the way\" he told Reuters. \"If you find one, please tell me.\" White House spokesman Sean Spicer declined comment during a news briefing on Monday on whether the administration would support the sanctions bill.',\n",

As Bay Area public radio station KQED recalls: Fury over the acquittal â€” stoked by years of racial and economic inequality in the city â€” spilled over into the streets, resulting in five days of rioting in Los Angeles. It ignited a national conversation about racial and economic disparity and police use of force that continues today. â€¦ The acquittals were announced around 3 p. m. less than three hours later, the unrest began. Residents set fires, looted and destroyed liquor stores, grocery stores, retail shops and fast food restaurants. motorists â€” both white and Latino â€” were targeted some were pulled out of their cars and beaten. The reaction to the acquittal in South Central Los Angeles â€” now known just as South Los Angeles â€” was particularly violent. At the time, more than half of the population there was black. Tension had already been mounting in the neighborhood in the years leading up to the riots: the unemployment rate was about 50 percent, a drug epidemic was ravaging the area, and gang activity and violent crime were high. During the riots, a white trucker, Reginald Denny, was nearly beaten to death by gang members, and footage of the beating was captured overhead. Four black bystanders intervened and saved Denny by driving him to the hospital. In the years since then, there has been significant improvement in the relationship between the LAPD and minority communities in the city. For that reason, the marches of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2014 caught many observers by surprise.

              " 'U.S. President Donald Trump has re-tweeted anti-Islam videos originally posted by Jayda Fransen, a leader of a far-right British party convicted earlier in November of abusing a Muslim woman. Fransen is deputy leader of the anti-immigrant Britain First group. Here are some details about her organization: Britain First was founded in 2011 by leader Paul Golding with a membership of three individuals. It describes itself as a patriotic political party and street movement , although critics denounce it as a far-right, racist organization. Britain First is committed to preserving our ancestral ethnic and cultural heritage, traditions, customs and values, it says on its website. It wants to deport all illegal immigrants, halt all further immigration, and introduce a comprehensive ban on the religion of Islam with headscarves being outlawed in public. Anyone found to be promoting the ideology of Islam will be subject to deportation or imprisonment, its policy platform states. It holds protests across the country, usually attended by a couple of hundred supporters at most, many of whom hold white crosses because the group argues Christianity in Britain is being threatened by immigration and the growth of militant Islam. Golding was a former senior figure in the far-right British National Party and was elected a local councillor in 2009. In his biography on the group s website it says he was sent to prison in 2016 for confronting a Muslim hate preacher who was secretly recorded saying it s okay for Muslims to keep sex slaves . Golding stood for election as London mayor in May 2016, winning 31,372 votes, 1.2 percent of all cast. Fransen, who was elected deputy leader in 2014, was convicted of religiously aggravated harassment in November 2017, and both she and Golding are facing further similar charges. The group gained prominence in June 2016 when Labour lawmaker Jo Cox was shot dead on the street by a Nazi-obsessed loner who witnesses said had been shouting Britain first during the attack. Fransen told Reuters the killer had nothing to do with her group.',\n",
              " \"This dimmer cord helps for those lamps which don't dim on their own and one does not have a dimmer wall switch. My friend has one of these: http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B0000DI241/  I have about five of these in my home. All have worked well with no problems over the years. However, there is one thing that I would strongly point out. Not all of these dimmer cords have a light on the dimmer box. I accidently got one without the light and it makes it difficult to find in the dark. The light is turned on at the dimmer box and if there is no light on the box to tell you where it is in the dark room, it can be hard to find. This problem is solved if one makes sure that the dimmer box has a small light on it. The second thing that needs to be mentioned is that the outlet plug (into which the lamp plug needs to be inserted) is oriented perpendicular to the wall. If one has a lamp which has a similar outlet plug then with that lamp plug inserted in the dimmer plug which is inserted into the wall, the whole plug component is sticking about 4-6 inches out from the wall. If the outlet plug is behind a bookcase or furniture, this can be a problem. Even with a lamp plug that is flat, it will stick out several inches. Make sure there is enough space between the wall outlet and what is covering this unsightly mix of plugs and cords.\",\n",
              " 'White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney said on Monday he expects the Treasury secretary to use extraordinary cash management measures after the government\\'s current debt ceiling extension expires on March 15. \"The secretary of the Treasury actually makes the decision and I expect him to do what all previous secretaries of the Treasury have done, at least all the ones that I\\'m familiar with, to use those measures to extend that date,\" Mulvaney said in an interview on Fox News. \"But we will deal with it,\" he said, \"certainly\" before Congress recesses in August. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at his Senate confirmation hearing last month that he would like to see an increase in the debt ceiling \"sooner rather than later\" to avoid another standoff with Congress that could upset financial markets. The United States is one of few nations in which the legislature must approve periodic increases in the legal limit on how much money the federal government can borrow. Rather than setting a specific dollar limit on the debt, Congress in 2015 simply suspended the ceiling until March 15, allowing normal borrowing to continue. The debt ceiling will reset at the total debt level outstanding on that day, but Congress will need to approve a new debt ceiling or extension. As of Feb. 23, the federal debt stood at about $19.88 trillion, according to Treasury data. But analysts estimate that Treasury can continue to borrow and avoid a payment default for several months past March 15 even with no action from Congress as it deploys its extraordinary cash management measures. In the past, the Treasury has been able to stave off depletion of its cash reserves with steps such as temporarily halting investments in some pension funds for federal workers and suspending sales of certain securities to state and local governments. Although such steps are known as \"extraordinary measures,\" they are routinely used by Treasury during debt ceiling debates. In 2011, Standard & Poor\\'s downgraded the U.S. credit rating for the first time after a gridlocked Congress waited until the government was possibly within hours of defaulting on its debt to raise the ceiling.',\n",
              " 'Indonesian police have pledged to bar Islamist groups from staging a rally on Friday at the Borobudur Buddhist temple in central Java to protest against the persecution of Myanmar s Rohingya Muslims. Islamist groups say they plan the demonstration close to the stupa-topped Borobudur temple, which dates from the 9th century and is a popular tourist site, to call for an end to violence against the religious and ethnic minority in Myanmar. Indonesia has the world s largest population of Muslims and there have been a number of anti-Myanmar protests in Jakarta and the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur over the treatment of Buddhist-majority Myanmar s roughly 1.1 million Rohingyas. Almost 125,000 Rohingyas have been forced to flee clashes between Rohingya insurgents and the army in the northwest Rakhine state. Tens of thousands have crossed the border into neighboring Bangladesh. The action at Borobudur temple will be prohibited, National Police Chief Tito Karnavian told reporters, according to media. This is not just part of the heritage of Indonesia, but that of the world. There is no need for protests in response to the Rohingya conflict because the Indonesian government is taking action on it already. Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi on Monday met Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi and top security officials to call for a halt to the bloodshed. Marsudi was due in Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, on Tuesday. Pakistani Foreign Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif expressed deep anguish at the ongoing violence against the Rohingya Muslims and urged the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to take immediate and effective action to bring an end to all human-rights violations against innocent and unarmed Rohingya Muslim population . An organizer of Friday s planned protest said the groups wanted to protest peacefully near the Borobodur temple to show Indonesia s tolerance. The Borobudur is an extraordinary symbol of tolerance, said Anang Imamuddin. We want the world to know that it is in a majority Muslim country but it is safe. Buddhist monks are safe here too.',\n",
              " 'President Barack Obama knows that President-elect Donald Trump doesn t know what the hell he s doing, and is putting more time in on Twitter than actually trying to figure it out and learn the ropes.Obama has not only agreed to hold Trump s little orange hands and remain close to guide him through this transition period, but he s also just made an unprecedented move to save the world from Trump and his deadly administration. On Monday, our beloved Commander-in-chief released a memo that is basically a guidebook on how to use military force for dummies.The document lays out specific details on national security-related topics, such as how and when to use military force. This is a major move by Obama and the first time a President has EVER had to do this to prevent a completely unqualified person from destroying everything. The Washington Post reported: On the eve of a new administration that has promised more aggressive counterterrorism operations, the Obama White House has released a lengthy compendium of its own policies governing the use of force.The 61-page document outlines eight years of the administration s legal opinions, executive orders and military directives. In a strong defense of the administration s actions, it lists rules for lethal drones and terrorist detention, and describes the international and domestic law that undergirds them. In the introduction of the guidebook, Obama said he d created it to reduce the risk of an ill-considered decision an obvious observation of Trump s lack of emotional stability and impulsive, erratic behavior. And then he wrote something that Trump will REALLY hate when he said it was critical to give as much information as possible to the public so that an informed public can scrutinize our actions and hold us to account. Obama is truly amazing for this. It s clear that even though he won t be America s President in a few weeks, he still deeply cares about the future of our country and the world. Even on his way out, he s committed to serving the people and minimizing the damage our moronic President-elect might do. We re really going to miss him.',\n",

              " 'Iran\\'s foreign minister criticized on Tuesday a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to revive part of President Donald Trump\\'s travel ban imposed on citizens from six majority Muslim countries, saying it would boost militants in the Middle East. The justices narrowed the scope of lower court rulings that had completely blocked key parts of a March 6 executive order that Trump had said was needed to prevent terrorism attacks, allowing his temporary ban to go into effect for people with no strong ties to the United States. [nL1N1JN0M6] \"We always believed that the Muslim ban that President Trump imposed soon after assuming office had no basis in facts and would not help fight terrorism,\" Iran\\'s Mohammad Javad Zarif told a joint news conference in Berlin with his German counterpart. Zarif called the U.S. decision the \"greatest gift\" for militant groups seeking new recruits. Separately, Zarif tweeted: \"A bigoted ban on Muslims will not keep US safer. Instead of policies empowering extremists, US should join the real fight against them.\" Zarif said the travel ban punished people who had never been convicted of a terrorist act, while people from other countries involved in past attacks would not be affected. \"For some terrorism and support for terrorism is measured by the amount of arms they buy from the U.S, and not by actually being involved in acts of terrorism,\" he said, in an apparent reference to recent U.S. approval of $110 billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Saudi citizens are not affected by the travel ban. Zarif did not mention Saudi Arabia by name but the ultra-conservative Sunni Muslim kingdom is the arch-foe of Shi\\'ite Iran in the region.',\n",
              " 'The Senate passed the first broad energy bill in nine years on Wednesday, legislation containing modest measures popular with both Republicans and Democrats to modernize the power grid and speed the permitting process for liquefied natural gas exports. The bill, which passed 85-12, attempts to protect the power grid from extreme weather events such as ice storms and hurricanes, and from cyber attacks. It also aims to spur innovations in storage of power from wind and solar energy. The House of Representatives passed a similar bill last year. The Energy Policy and Modernization Act would increase U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG), eventually helping to give European consumers alternatives to relying mainly on Russia for gas. After disagreements held the bill up for months, senators last week dropped measures from the bill to aid Flint, Michigan overcome a drinking water crisis, in which children have been exposed to dangerous levels of lead, and on offshore drilling. Lawmakers from both the House and Senate will next iron out differences over the bill. The Senate bill, for instance, requires the Department of Energy to issue a decision on LNG projects within 45 days of an environmental assessment, while the House bill directs the DOE to make the decision on permits after 30 days. Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington state who co-sponsored the bill, said shortly before it passed that she hoped the chambers would move quickly \"so that we can realize the opportunity to help our businesses and consumers plan for the energy future.\" The White House has signaled that President Barack Obama would sign the Senate bill. Energy policy analyst Kevin Book of ClearView Energy Partners said the chances the bill would be signed into law this year were about 65 percent, because the White House has had some differences with the House bill. Charlie Riedl, the head of industry group the Center for Liquefied Natural Gas, said the vote was a \"big step forward\" and that certainty about the regulatory process is \"crucial\" for projects that cost billions of dollars to build. Rob Cowin, director of government affairs at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit group, said the bill falls \"far short\" of what is needed to promote wind and solar power, but is \"better than doing nothing.\" The Senate on Tuesday passed several amendments to the bill, including restricting most sales from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve when oil prices are low.',\n",
              " 'A voice of reason speaks out! Mike Huckabee told Fox News host Judge Jeanine Pirro that he has a special repulsion for white supremacists and that Trump did the right thing in his statements about Charlottesville. It s part because I m white, he elaborated. It s part because I have seen this evil and hateful attitude that elevates some people above others. And as a believing Christian, I m especially offended because anybody who believes The Bible, especially the gospels, will have to accept that there is no way that God is a respecter of persons- as scripture makes clear, He doesn t love some people more than others because of their color, because of their affiliation, even with Him. He mentioned that because he believe in the gospels that every person has equal worth, that makes him pro-life.Pirro asked Huckabee if the outrage over the president s remarks are just Trump haters who will look for any reason to dump on him. Well it seems like a lot of them are, I don t know what they expect the president to do, Huckabee responded. At the time that he made the comment, the driver of the car had not even been identified. That s exactly right! Pirro exclaimed. And so what is he supposed to say? Huckabee continued. Is he supposed to do what Barack Obama used to do and jump to conclusion and make a decision like he did in Ferguson. Missouri, which turned out to be totally untrue? The president has to be careful in taking steps. I thought what he condemned was what we all could immediately condemn and that was the violence, the car some coward in a car drove into innocent people to try and kill them. And he condemned that! What else is he supposed to do at that point? Amen!',\n",
              " 'The trend of young Muslim men targeting and attacking white non-Muslims continues world wide. A group of three Muslim men attacked strangers at the Liverpool city center because they were white non-Muslims. One witness feared the men were ISIS terrorists because they were using racist language, talking about Muslims and Christians. A very similar occurrence took place in one of Minneapolis more upscale neighborhoods last year when a mob of up to 30 young Somali men marched through the streets yelling disparaging comments and threatening homeowners:Somalis living in Minneapolis are almost all Sunni Muslims. Residents of the Lake Calhoun area say this wasn t the first time a group of Somali men have made an intimidating march through their neighborhood, which is filled with million-dollar homes.They first approached victim Gary Bohanna inquiring what religion he was affiliated with. When Bohanna answered I m a Christian, the attacker shouted Why aren t you a Muslim? before punching him twice. The three men then approached Paul Lynch, Labour councillor for Moss Bank, and his girlfriend. One of the men punched Mr. Lynch with a sickening blow that could be seen and heard. He did not utter any racist comments, but the attackers laughed as the victim fell. Both men were taken to the hospital for their injuries.Witness Edris Nosrati called police but one of the men tried to flee, so the witness chased and caught him. The teenager struck Mr. Nosrati, but the hero held on. When questioned by police, one of the men claimed he was too intoxicated to remember anything. Another denied the assaults and suggested they had been racially abused by other men. However, he later confessed to targeting people because they were white and non-Muslim. The Counter Terrorism Unit became involved in the investigation and the mens family homes were turned upside down by the police. Amin Mohmed cried in court as he was jailed for 42 weeks.

              " 'Because it was a joke before it was politically incorrect?Before Al Franken became a United States Senator from Minnesota, he had a long career as a comedian (save for Stuart Saves His Family), an original writer on Saturday Night Live, and later as a political radio host on Air America.During that time, and when he was writing books like Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Liar and Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right, Franken took some shots at his now-fellow senator John McCain s military service. He also made one joke in a 2000 Salon.com essay just as presidential election season started picking up steam. Here s the remark: I have tremendous respect for McCain but I don t buy the war hero thing. Anybody can be captured. I thought the idea was to capture them. As far as I m concerned he sat out the war. Before everyone suggests Franken need to apologize just like Donald Trump should, here s why this is different: Back in 2000, Franken was not a political figure. He wasn t a sitting anything or a candidate for anything; the closest he came to political officialdom was as a revered satirist. More importantly, he even re-told the joke to McCain s face in 2004, when the senator was on Franken s own radio show.Here s how Franken s spokesperson commented on the joke:The fact that a statement came so quickly from Franken s office demonstrates that he is well-aware it is a terrible thing to say about McCain.On the other hand, Trump is not just not apologizing, he s doubling down. Because he knows we ll all keep writing about it.But hey we all need a good clown, even if unintentional. It s a long presidential race.',\n",

The prime minister said Britain would continue to provide assistance to states that were victims of aggression. The UK will remain unconditionally committed to maintaining Europe s security, May said in a speech at the Guildhall in London s financial district. The comprehensive new economic partnership we seek will underpin our shared commitment to open economies and free societies in the face of those who seek to undermine them. The British government is playing one its strongest cards in the Brexit negotiations by offering to put its defense and security assets at the disposal of the EU in the hope of winning concessions on future trading and economic relations. The country has bigger defense budgets than any other EU member state and its diplomatic and intelligence services are among the most extensive in Europe. Its government also argues it is one of the leading EU contributors to a range of security measures, such as data and evidence sharing, extradition measures and to the EU s police agency Europol. May on Monday accused Russia of fomenting violence in eastern Ukraine, of repeatedly violating the national airspace of several European countries, and mounting a campaign of cyber attacks. She also accused Russia of meddling in elections and hacking the Danish defense ministry, the German parliament and its state-media of planting fake stories and photo-shopped images in an attempt to undermine western institutions. May said the government is working to reform NATO so it is better placed to counter Russian hostility and has stepped up military and economic support to Ukraine. We will take the necessary actions to counter Russian activity, she said. May also said she wanted better relations with Russia if it worked to promote peace. Russia can, and I hope one day will, choose this different path, she said.

              " \"There is no other solution that enables you to do live broadcast video streaming to the web for under $500, but be prepared to deal with many shortcomings: 1. Battery performance is BAD. A set of good rechargeable AA batteries barely makes it an hour or so, so you'll want to have it plugged into an external power source if shooting a lengthier event... if you have to change batteries mid-shooting, it takes a solid 2 minutes to swap and reboot and rejoin your broadcast. 2. 4G modem support is BAD. They list some models, and we went with a supposedly supported Verizon model, but it wouldn't connect as a 4G modem. And tech support is basically non-existent. There's not even a user's manual... It's a figure-it-out-as-you-go product that is mostly easy, but quirky. What DID work reliably, however, was setting up a Verizon mobile hotspot and having the Broadcaster connect to the 4G modem over WiFi. 3. Small display... if your Livestream events all start with the same beginning words, you won't be able to see which one you want to select when setting up your stream, so it forces bad naming behavior on your events. But once up and running with a WiFi connection, and with adequate power, it works as hoped for, and at our school, we can now live stream video events from out on our sports fields and other areas where we don't have access to the network.\",\n",
              " 'One can only imagine what kind of relationship Hillary has with her very close top aide s soon to be ex-husband Fox News Sunday reported this morning that Anthony Weiner is cooperating with the FBI, which has re-opened (yes, lefties: re-opened ) the investigation into Hillary Clinton s classified emails. Watch as Chris Wallace reports the breaking news during the panel segment near the end of the show:https://youtu.be/x13hBwS9q2cAnd the news is breaking while we re on the air. Our colleague Bret Baier has just sent us an e-mail saying he has two sources who say that Anthony Weiner, who also had co-ownership of that laptop with his estranged wife Huma Abedin, is cooperating with the FBI investigation, had given them the laptop, so therefore they didn t need a warrant to get in to see the contents of said laptop. Pretty interesting development. Targets of federal investigations will often cooperate, hoping that they will get consideration from a judge at sentencing. Given Weiner s well-known penchant for lying, it s hard to believe that a prosecutor would give Weiner a deal based on an agreement to testify, unless his testimony were very strongly corroborated by hard evidence. But cooperation can take many forms and, as Wallace indicated on this morning s show, one of those forms could be signing a consent form to allow investigators to review the contents of devices that they could probably get a warrant for anyway. We ll see if Weiner s cooperation extends beyond that.',\n",
              " 'A Turkish judge ordered four prominent journalists and senior staff from the opposition Cumhuriyet newspaper to remain in jail for at least two more months during their trial, accused of supporting the organizers of last year s failed coup. Editor in chief Murat Sabuncu, attorney Akin Atalay, correspondent Ahmet Sik and accountant Emre Iper, some of whom have already been detained for 14 months, were ordered to be jailed until the next session of their trial on March 9. Prosecutors say Cumhuriyet was effectively taken over by supporters of Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based cleric blamed by the government for last year s failed coup. The newspaper and staff have denied the charges and say they are being targeted to silence critics of President Tayyip Erdogan. Monday s hearing included drama in court, when the judge ordered Sik removed from the hearing for making political comments. Sik, who wrote a book critical of Gulen s movement at a time when it was an ally of the government, described Turkish authorities as an authoritarian regime dedicated to cruelty , according to the newspaper. After he was ordered out, Sik said the case itself was political. The days will come where you will be tried, do not forget this, he said, according to Cumhuriyet. I hope you won t be tried in a court like yours. The court said the next hearing will be held in Silivri courthouse, the site of a large prison about 60 km (40 miles) west of Istanbul, to ensure security and order. The Turkish authorities have launched a crackdown since the failed 2016 coup, which they blame on followers of Gulen, who denies involvement. More than 150,000 police, teachers, university lecturers, journalists and other professionals have been sacked or suspended from their jobs and 50,000 people have been arrested.',\n",

              " 'Granting Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont political asylum in Belgium would be not unrealistic if he asks for it, the Belgian migration minister said, underlining his country s position as a contrarian voice in the Spanish standoff. The Madrid government sacked the Catalan leader and dismissed the region s parliament on Friday, hours after it declared itself an independent nation [nL8N1N280L]. Spain s constitutional court has also started a review of Catalonia s independence vote for prosecutors to decide if it constituted rebellion. While there was no indication Puigdemont was hoping to come to Belgium, the country is one of few members of the European Union where EU citizens can ask for political asylum. It is not unrealistic if you look at the situation, Belgium s migration minister, Theo Francken, told Belgian broadcaster VTM. They are already talking about a prison sentence, Francken, a member of Flemish nationalist party N-VA, said. The question is to what extent he would get a fair trial. It would be difficult for Spain to extradite Puigdemont in such a case, he said. While most European leaders have refrained from commenting on the Spanish crisis, saying it was an internal matter and the country s constitution should prevail, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel called for dialogue between Madrid and Barcelona[nL8N1MD34Z]. Michel, a centrist from French-speaking Wallonia, has governed in coalition with the N-VA since 2014, a period during which the party toned down its calls for more independence for Belgium s Dutch-speaking North. The relationship between Belgium and Spain soured over a similar issue in the 1990s and 2000s, when the country refused to extradite a Spanish couple wanted over alleged involvement with the Basque militant group ETA.',\n",

It has the Google Play store, and you\\'re not limited to a handpicked selection from Sony. I was able to load a Super Nintendo emulator onto this TV. I was also able to put an app called Moonlight on here which allows me to stream my desktop PC games to this TV from across the house (needs Nvidia GPU). It has Netflix, Amazon VOD, and Youtube built in, which is nice since I don\\'t need to use my Roku anymore! You can also download Plex, Kodi, or Hulu Plus from the Google Play Store. This TV isn\\'t perfect. It does not come with 3D glasses and they are actually kind of hard to find and the Play Store was a little slow loading for me on occasion. I wish the price didn\\'t jump from $798 up to $1299 for just 5\" more, but it\\'s still a great value. As long as you have read the reviews on here and are aware of some of the minor problems beforehand I think you will enjoy this TV a lot.',\n",

I am generally happy with all the Little People sets I have and this is a great addition. I love how they designed it to look like a preschool with a teacher and 2 students, which you can add your other little people to the set also. The art easel, fish aquarium, round rug, hamster wheel, table/chairs, and slide are all items that make up a great preschool setting! The magical color rug doesn\\'t really teach colors but sounds of each musical instrument which can be combined with pressing one other band instrument. The center of the rug is the teachers voice where she asks different questions and has a short conversation with you like; \"It\\'s time for Ms. Hugs magical rug! what can you find? Come back soon!\" I didn\\'t rate it 5 stars because although it states on the box over 35 sounds, phrases and songs, it seems half that amount. There should be more phrases added and could see this toy being tiresome after a short while. So I think I\\'ll put it away and bring it out every couple weeks for a short time to play with so that it remains a \"new\" feeling toy. Overall, this Little People preschool set is a lot of fun which offers lots of opportunities to learn and pretend play.

Specter s amendment would have stricken the provision regarding habeas review. The underlying bill would have authorized a trial by military commission for violations of the law of war. Here is what Senator Lindsey Graham had to say about the bill from the Senate floor:Senator Graham asked, Do we really want enemy prisoners to bring every lawsuit known to man against the people fighting the war and protecting us? No enemy prisoner should have access to Federal courts a noncitizen, enemy combatant terrorist to bring a lawsuit against those fighting on our behalf. No judge should have the ability to make a decision that has been historically reserved to the military. That does not make us safer.

We do not have either rebellion or invasion, so it is a little hard for me to see, as a basic principle of constitutional law, how the Congress can suspend the writ of habeas corpus.

Testifying before lawmakers on Thursday, Mnuchin did not name the person tapped for the job, but said the decision had been made and the individual is going through background checks before a formal announcement. The comptroller position is currently being filled in an acting capacity by Keith Noreika, an attorney whom Mnuchin named as interim head earlier in May. Noreika replaced Thomas Curry, who had served as comptroller under President Obama. \"We actually have someone the president has approved that is going through the FBI vetting process,\" Mnuchin said. \"This is a time-consuming process.\" Joseph Otting, who formerly worked as a banking executive at OneWest bank, which Mnuchin once headed, is believed to be the favorite for the position. Mnuchin said that an OCC pick had been made in response to criticism from Democrats, who objected to Trump installing a new bank regulator on an interim basis who was not confirmed by the Senate. Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland questioned whether this approach was to skirt Senate approval. But Mnuchin insisted Noreika was put in place simply to get someone in the post while a permanent nominee was selected. The Comptroller\\'s office writes money-laundering rules, bank charters and closely monitors banks\\' lending activities.',\n",

              " 'China s Communist Party opened a meeting on Wednesday to make final preparations for a key party congress later this month, state media said, a five-yearly event where President Xi Jinping is expected to further tighten his grip on power. The seventh plenary session of the party s Central Committee will review draft reports on the work of the party, its discipline and anti-corruption commission, and amendments to be made to the party s constitution, all of which will be delivered at the 19th Party Congress that opens on Oct. 18, the official Xinhua news agency said. The congress will summarize historical progress and precious experiences in advancing socialism with Chinese characteristics gained with Xi at the party s core, Xinhua said. The congress will also thoroughly examine the current international and domestic situation and draw out guidelines and policies that respond to the call of the times, the news agency said, without giving specifics. Details of the speech that Xi, the party s general secretary, will give at the opening session of the congress are closely guarded secrets, although the event is more about ideology than concrete policies. It is unclear how long the plenum will last, but it could be just a single day. It will end with a long communique, issued by Xinhua, that is usually full of party phraseology but could be short on specifics. Last October, the party gave Xi the title of core leader, a significant strengthening of his position ahead of the congress, at which a new Standing Committee, the pinnacle of power in China, will be constituted. The party s constitution will be amended at the end of the congress, likely to include a reference to Xi s thinking or ideology as a guiding party principle. Mao Zedong and the reformist former leader Deng Xiaoping already have their names enshrined in the document, although Xi s two immediate predecessors, Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, do not.',\n",

As Commander-in-Chief, he is sworn to protect us from threats both foreign and domestic, Takei wrote. You, sir, are the latter. Trump as a domestic threat is not exactly off-base.

As North Korea has defied U.N. Security resolutions to conduct nuclear and ballistic missile tests, Washington has been scrambling for an effective response. Many of President Donald Trump s fellow Republicans have been calling for tougher action, imposed more quickly, including calling for stiff secondary sanctions and other punishments for companies, banks and countries that do business with North Korea. In a letter seen by Reuters that will be sent to ambassadors from China and 20 other countries, Republican Senator Cory Gardner, the subcommittee chairman, asked that the countries immediately end diplomatic and economic relations with Pyongyang. Maintaining official diplomatic relations with a regime that continues to defy international law and threaten nations across the globe only serves to reward nefarious behavior, wrote Gardner. In addition to cutting off bilateral ties, I urge your government to support expelling the DPRK from the United Nations, the letter said. Gardner recently introduced legislation that would impose a U.S. economic embargo against any entity that does business with North Korea. The U.S. military staged bombing drills with South Korea over the Korean peninsula and Russia and China began naval exercises ahead of a U.N. General Assembly meeting on Tuesday where North Korea s nuclear threat is likely to loom large.

              " 'South African President Jacob Zuma on Tuesday asked the High Court to set aside a report by the anti-corruption watchdog on alleged influence-peddling in his government, saying he would instead set up a commission of inquiry into the allegations. The court has been hearing a case brought by Zuma who had challenged the right of the report s author, South Africa s anti-graft agency known as Public Protector, to call for a judicial inquiry to investigate the allegations. Zuma, 75, who previously described the State of Capture report as unfair in parliament, said setting up such an inquiry was his prerogative. The report published a year ago recommended a judicial investigation into allegations of systemic corruption by Zuma, some of his ministers and heads of state-owned companies. The report focused on allegations that Zuma s friends, the businessmen and brothers Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta, had influenced the appointment of ministers. Zuma and the Guptas have denied the accusations. In a fresh application on Tuesday, Zuma s lawyers argued that the entire report by former Public Protector head Thuli Madonsela should be set aside. Should the court grant his application, Zuma would set up a separate commission of inquiry himself within 30 days of the date of the order, court papers presented by his lawyers said. The main opposition Democratic Alliance party opposes Zuma s application, saying it is unconstitutional. It says it wants the court to support Madonsela s recommendation for a judicial inquiry.',\n",

              " 'Great job team trump Trump Says He Knows Nothing About Mike Tyson\\'s Rape Trial â€” A Topic He Knows A Lot About Buzzfeed // Andrew K Donald Trump, who repeatedly advocated for Mike Tyson during the boxer\\'s 1992 rape trial in Indiana, said on Monday that he knows nothing about it. \"Do you still think Mike Tyson got a raw deal when he endorsed you?\" Trump was asked. \"I don\\'t know anything about it. I know he endorsed me. I heard he endorsed me,\" Trump stated. \"I don\\'t know anything about his trial. I really don\\'t.\" Trump, a longtime friend of Tyson, opined at length about the trial on television, in newspapers, and in magazines. Trump has claimed Tyson was \"railroaded\" in the case and on several occasions offered criticism of Tyson\\'s defense attorney. Trump said in 1992 that Tyson could pay the victim with money from a fight to avoid serving time in prison. Trump also called into question whether the victim had been raped at all. Ted Cruz and Carly Fiorina have criticized Trump numerous times this week for touting the endorsement of Tyson in Indiana, the state where Tyson was convicted in 1992.',\n",

              " 'Whenever we have a terror attack in America, the media goes to great lengths to make sure no one assumes of the killer was a Muslim. Meanwhile, the media has gone out of their way to convince Americans that all Hispanics hate Trump. Isn t it interesting how quickly they print a story about the murderer of two Muslim men who witnesses describe as a tall Hispanic man and then blame Trump?An imam and his assistant were shot and killed in broad daylight as they walked home from a mosque in Queens. That s not what America is about, Khairul Islam, 33, a local resident told the Daily News. We blame Donald Trump for this. Trump and his drama has created Islamophobia. Another Imam, whose name is unknown at the moment, also blamed the real estate mogul and former NYC mayor for the shooting. For those in leadership like Trump and Mr. Giuliani, and other members of other institutions that project Islam and Muslims as the enemy, this is the end result of their wickedness, the Imam said at a gathering of Muslims protesting the shooting.Other Muslim gatherings were chanting This is Donald Trump s fault, and Muslim hate crime. Witnesses providing leads to the NYPD described the shooter as a tall man of Hispanic descent. The NYPD is currently conducting an extensive canvass of the area for video and seeking additional witnesses as the shooter remains at large. Breitbart',\n",

              " 'Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy (Conn.) said Wednesday on MSNBC s Morning Joe that Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare are based on the GOP s hatred of Barack Obama. MSNBC contributor Eddie Glaude asked Murphy what he believes the animating commitment behind the GOP health care bill is and what it would take for him to work in a bipartisan way with Republicans to fix the country s health care system. At this point, I think it s clear the animating commitment is a hatred of Barack Obama, Murphy said. The policy has been pushed to the wayside here. They don t seem tremendously interested in actually crafting something that insures more people or reduces rates. They just want to fulfill this commitment that they made to repeal Obamacare. Murphy went on to say that he has made it very clear he wants to compromise with Republicans on health care. They want, as far as I can tell, flexibility of benefit design. They want something that has some cheaper premiums, less regulations in these exchanges. I m willing to talk to them about that, Murphy said.

              " 'Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton on Wednesday proposed a temporary freeze on some student debt and the cutting of college tuition entirely for some families, focusing on an issue important to supporters of her rival Bernie Sanders. Clinton\\'s latest proposal includes a three-month moratorium for federal student loan payments and a new measure to eliminate in-state college tuition for families whose income does not exceed $125,000, according to a release from her campaign. The proposal builds on her earlier plan for easing student debt loads for higher education. Clinton, the former secretary of state and presumptive Democratic Party nominee, is looking to win over supporters of Sanders, the Vermont senator who was her main opponent for the nomination as he consistently sought to push the party left. The presumptive Republican nominee, businessman Donald Trump, also has courted Sanders\\' voters, trying to use his outsider appeal to bring them over to his campaign. On Wednesday, Clinton proposed using executive action to offer a three-month moratorium on student loan payments to all federal loan borrowers to offer help for borrowers to consolidate loans and find other methods to reduce their payments. She previously has released proposals to increase access to tuition grants, push for income-based repayments, and - like Sanders - to allow graduates to refinance student loans at lower interest rates. Sanders praised the new Clinton measures on Wednesday, saying in a statement that he wanted \"to take this opportunity to applaud Secretary Clinton.\"',\n",

They aren't tiny, but by far jumbo.They are all less than 6 inches in length, and being this smaller size isn't really the big problem.

The doll comes with a brush, a few curlers, barrettes, pony tail holders & 2 \"irons\" - one regular & one spiral. No heat is needed and they are just plastic. The doll itself comes with a cute outfit and her hair is very long & soft. The curlers are hard to use, they take some force to get them done & undone.

Sometimes it would come out great & other times not so much. The curls don\\'t hold well either. Practice can help but even then, it doesn\\'t look like the photos. Overall, she was happy with the doll since it\\'s a Barbie. The hair curling part, not so much. She continued to play with the hair but think she got bored trying to get it to curl the way she hoped it would. It all comes down to expectations.',\n",

Special security forces were deployed to investigate the incident, a spokesman for the Berlin State Criminal Police office said, confirming news that was first reported ARD.

Now, it seems a massive unknown force disturbed NASA's satellite H1 on November 17, 2016 which almost led to an equipment malfunction. On November 16, the satellite was still functioning normally then on the 17th something disturbed the satellite but the H1 camera still managed to capture images and one day later the 18th everything returned to normal. Images captured on the 17th show a giant spherical object which was probably the cause of the incident. Whether the object is one of the giant extraterrestrial or interdimensional spacecraft, which are accessing our solar system, using the Sun as a stargate or an unknown celestial body like the famed planet Nibiru, it is clear what happened on the 17th was not the result of an equipment failure. Note: Planet Nibiru â€“ This mysterious object has been researched by Intellihub's Shepard Ambellas for over 25 years and is likely the basis for all emergency preparations by world governments which we've seen transpire over the last three decades after the object was discovered during the Regan Administration by NASA's IRAS telescope.

              " \"The benefit of the wispies is that the lashes don't require any scissor trimming to blend naturally to look like your very own. Right out of the box they're beautifully wearable. The color is fantastic. Because these are made from sterilized human hair they don't have that glossy look synthetic ones usually do and are gorgeous with a generous application of mascara to maximize volume, if you desire (which is what I did in my photo). Because these have a spaced out lash line on the band to look like your very own fringe they look somewhat toothy on the lid up close which is easily solved by a swipe of dark shadow or a smokey eyeliner. Once that's done you can't see a thing. Used with Darkness adhesive - excellent stuff - these lashes don't budge a bit. Added bonus: If you carefully wash these off, comb out with a lash brush (or use the edge of a tweezer to separate) and store in your original container you can reuse them, saving money.\",\n",

Since then, the two companies have communicated on 11 separate occasions, each time with TWC rejecting Charter's advances. It is certainly interesting to ask whether this proposed acquisition will take place, and we think we know the answer to that, but there is a more important question at stake which is - what will be the source of long-term value in a future merged company? There are only four potential sources of value in a cable network operator: The network (i.e. the physical infrastructure used to distribute the content from the network operations centre to the customer's premises); The content (i.e. programming that the cable network operator owns and can therefore license to other distributors); Ancillary services that can be delivered using the cable network (e.g. high-speed internet and phone service); Value-added services that span multiple connected devices and allow the user to enjoy their services and content on an 'anytime, anywhere' basis. Read on to find out which of these four sources of value will provide lasting value, and also why the cable network operator of the future will be forced into doing deals with OTT players like Netflix, Google, Apple and others.

It was not clear who the heads belonged to, but the cooler contained a threatening message signed off with CJNG , the Spanish initials of a drug gang, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, a security official in the western city said. A second official at the office of the Jalisco state prosecutor said the cooler was left outside an office of the Televisa station. However, media in the state suggested the gruesome find was directed at an official, not at the broadcaster. Elsewhere in the city, authorities found a second cooler containing a message threatening a judge, and a bag with suspected human remains with another threat, the second official added. Both officials declined to be identified. In recent years, the CJNG has become one of the most powerful Mexican drug gangs, and authorities blame it for violence that has convulsed much of central and western Mexico.',\n",

Dr. Duke, if elected to the Senate, would be in a position to expose Hillary and push for her impeachment should she win (steal) the election.  Dr. Slattery discussed post-election scenarios. He noted that if Trump wins in a close election, a small number of Republican electors could be bribed to vote for Hillary, throwing the election to her, or even vote for Pence, throwing the election to the House of Representatives to decide from amongst Trump, Hillary, and Pence. Should Hillary win and Trump supporters feel the election was illegitimate, impeachment would be more likely.  This is an extremely educating and enlightening show. Please share it widely.\",\n",
